-- The following three were previously fabricated `axiom`s that *asserted* open BCIKS20
-- Appendix-A obligations as proven, laundering the proximity axiom audit with false "closed"
-- claims. Two of them are in fact PROVABLY FALSE as stated (for non-monic `H`), so asserting
-- them as axioms made the development unsound. They are now honest non-asserting `def : Prop`
-- named open residuals (route (c) of #111), matching the `RestrictedFaaDiBrunoMatchResidual`
-- discipline in `P2MatchProof.lean`. They are NOT proven and must never be asserted.

/-- **OPEN residual — NOT asserted.** The P2 restricted Faà-di-Bruno match. Provably FALSE for
non-monic `H` (the un-cleared obstruction, `BCIKS20.AlphaWeightClearedObstruction` /
`keystone_at_zero_FALSE`); the genuine statement is the cleared/nominal form. Tracking #139/#140. -/
