# Disproof Log — ABF26 Proximity Prize Grand Challenge 1 (Issue #232)

Goal: keep trying to **disprove** the ABF26 Grand-Challenge-1 conjecture, then
**disprove the disproof**. Record every attempt so we don't repeat ourselves and
so we zero in. Keep lemmas that *constrain* even if they don't fully disprove.
Default assumption: my disproof is wrong — find the precise reason it fails and
make that reason a sorry-free Lean lemma.

## LITERATURE FRONTIER (2025–2026) — where the prize actually sits

A web-research pass (June 2026) located the precise state of the art. **Our verified carving at the
Johnson threshold `η₀=√ρ−ρ` (Loop10) is exactly the boundary the literature confirms.** Key papers:

* **PROVEN up to Johnson — Ben-Sasson–Carmon–Haböck–Kopparty–Saraf, eprint 2025/2055, Thm 1.3/1.5:**
  for RS rate `ρ` and `γ < 1−√ρ` (gap `η = 1−√ρ−γ`), proximity gaps hold with *polynomial* soundness
  `a > O_ρ(n/η⁵)`. ⇒ the large-gap side (`η > η₀`) is a **theorem** with poly soundness — matches
  Loop9/P1 and the in-tree Hab25 (MCA up to Johnson, Haböck eprint 2025/2110, and Bordage et al.
  2025/2051 "all polynomial generators satisfy MCA up to `1−(1+1/2m)√ρ`").
* **Capacity conjecture is FALSE — three independent groups (Nov 2025).** BUT each misses the prize:
  - **Crites–Stewart 2025/2046** (reduction to list-decoding): disprove the *up-to-CAPACITY* versions
    (CA, **MCA-of-WHIR**, DEEP-FRI list-decodability) at `δ ≥ 1−ρ`. They *propose the salvageable form*
    `δ ≤ 1−ρ−η` — i.e. exactly the prize's below-capacity regime is the proposed survivor, not refuted.
  - **Diamond–Gruen 2025/2010**: super-poly error `err > n^{c*}/q` for every `c*` — but at **vanishing
    rate** `ρ ≈ e·n^{1/3}/n → 0` (`k(n)=⌊e·n^{1/3}⌋`, `q=n^{c*+1}`), *not* a fixed prize rate
    `ρ∈{1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16}`. The prize's `ρ^{−c₂}` factor is precisely what their vanishing-`ρ`
    construction would have to beat at *fixed* `ρ`, which it does not address.
  - **Ben-Sasson et al. 2025/2055, Thm 1.6** (impossibility, char 2, beyond Johnson): proximity loss
    `<1/8` requires soundness `a ≥ n^{2−o(1)}` — a **quadratic** (`n²`) jump. **Loop11 shows `n²` is
    WITHIN the prize bound** (`(2^m)^{c₁}`, `c₁=2`, under `n ≤ 2^m`). So the quadratic jump does **not**
    disprove the polynomial-soundness prize; it is consistent with it.
* **Near-capacity positive results exist only for FOLDED / RANDOM RS** — Goyal–Guruswami 2025/2054
  (`(1−R−η)`-proximity gap for folded & random RS, field `≳ 1/η²`); folded-RS optimal gap via subspace
  designs, arXiv 2601.10047 (Jan 2026). **Plain deterministic smooth-domain RS** (the prize's
  multiplicative-subgroup domain) in the band `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ−η]` is **NOT** covered by these.

**Net position of the prize** (MCA, smooth deterministic domain, *fixed* prize rate, `δ ≤ 1−ρ−η`,
*polynomial* bound `poly(2^m,1/ρ,1/η)/q`): **genuinely open.** It is *not* settled by the Nov-2025
disproofs — those need exact capacity (Crites–Stewart), vanishing rate (Diamond–Gruen), or give only
quadratic-hence-allowed bounds (BCIKS 2055). The open core is precisely Loop10's small-gap band, and
the deciding question is whether *deterministic smooth-domain* RS behaves like the
generic/folded case (poly soundness ⇒ prize TRUE) or like Diamond–Gruen's adversarial low-rate
families (super-poly ⇒ prize FALSE) — at *fixed* prize rate. No construction currently reaches that.

**Resolved-prize bibliography to formalize next (O11/O12):** port Ben-Sasson 2025/2055 Thm 1.5
(poly soundness up to Johnson) and the Crites–Stewart reduction (CA-beyond-capacity ⇒ impossible
list-decoding) — the latter is a clean disproof of the *at-capacity* sibling we can make sorry-free.

## The target

Live target: the field-universal, faithful GS form
`MCAGS.epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` / `MCAGS.UniversalGSListMassBound`.
There must be one constant triple `c₁,c₂,c₃`, chosen before the field, such that
for every prize rate `ρ = prizeRates j`, gap `η > 0`, and radius

    δ ≤ 1 − ρ − η          (★ strictly below list-decoding capacity 1−ρ)

there exists a faithful GS list family whose GS-exposed MCA error obeys

    epsMCAgs(RS_ρ, δ, L) ≤ (1/q) · (2^m)^{c₁} / (ρ^{c₂} η^{c₃}).

Do **not** re-target the stale surfaces:
`MCAGS.epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture domain m` is fixed-field and already a theorem
(`epsMCAgs_prizeBound_conjecture_holds`, constants can absorb `q`), while
`uniformEpsMCAgsPrizeBoundConjecture` with `∀ L` is already false as stated
(`MCAGSPrizeRefutation.not_uniformEpsMCAgsPrizeBoundConjecture`) because arbitrary
adversarial list families are not the genuine decoder output.

The single most important structural fact is the gap `η > 0` in (★): the radius is
held **strictly below capacity**. Any disproof must produce a super-polynomial
correlation/list *while staying inside* (★).

## Attempts

### A1 — BKR additive-subspace vanishing explosion (`SolutionDisproof.lean`, `CandidateDisproofLoop1`)
Idea: in char 2, a smooth `L` contains an additive subspace `V`, `|V|=2^b`; set
received word `r=0`; every `P = Q·A_V` (`A_V` = subspace-vanishing poly) agrees with
`r` on `V`. Count `|F|^{k−|V|}` such `P` → exponential list.
**Refuted (A1):** to be a δ-close codeword, `P` must *agree* on ≥ `(1−δ)·|L|` points,
so the vanishing/agreement set has `|V| ≥ (1−δ)|L|`. Free dimension `k−|V|`. With
`k = ρ|L|` and (★) `1−δ ≥ ρ+η`, we get `|V| ≥ (ρ+η)|L| > ρ|L| = k`, so `k−|V| < 0`:
**zero** free polynomials, not exponentially many. The explosion only exists at/above
capacity (`δ ≥ 1−ρ`), which (★) forbids. → verified as
`below_capacity_kills_vanishing_explosion` (Loop4, sorry-free).

### A2 — Multiplicative trace-fiber variant (`CandidateDisproofLoop1`)
Idea: project cyclic `L` onto an additive basis via absolute trace `Tr`; use a trace
fiber as `V`.
**Refuted (A2):** `0 ∉ L` (multiplicative group) so trace fibers in `L` are not
additive subspaces; the affine-shifted fiber `V` has `|V| ≤ deg Tr = 2^{127}`, forcing
`k > 2^{127}` to get any free dimension, i.e. `ρ ≈ 1`, outside the prize rates
`{1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16}`. Same dimension-budget wall as A1.

### A3 — High-degree aliasing `X^{|L|}−1` (`CandidateDisproofLoop2`)
Idea: `X^{|L|}−1 ≡ 0` on `L`; `P = Q·(X^{|L|}−1)` matches `r=0` everywhere on `L`.
**Refuted (A3):** `deg(X^{|L|}−1) = |L| > k`, so every such `P` has degree ≥ `|L| > k`
and is disqualified from the degree-`<k` code. A special case of the A1 wall with
`|V| = |L|`.

### A4 — Interleaved coset clustering (`CandidateDisproofLoop3`)
Idea: factor `|L| = d₁·d₂`, concentrate errors into a few cosets, GS-decode clean
cosets, cross-pollinate to explode the global list.
**Refuted (A4):** coset decomposition is an isomorphism; the GS list size is governed
by the *global* code rate / Johnson radius, not by per-coset topology. Concentrating
errors onto cosets only reshapes *which* `(1−δ)|L|` points agree — it cannot lower the
agreement-set size below `(1−δ)|L|`, so the A1 wall still applies globally.

### O1 (attempted) — attack the MCA *correlation probability*, not the list size
Idea: a polynomial-size list can still in principle carry an anomalously large
correlated-agreement probability; bound `epsMCAgs` from below directly.
**Refuted-into-a-constraint (O1):** below the Johnson radius `δ < 1−√ρ`, BCIKS20 already
gives the `poly/q` correlation bound (the cited proximity-gap floor), so any correlation
disproof must squeeze into the band `1−√ρ ≤ δ ≤ 1−ρ−η`. That band is non-empty **only
if** `η ≤ √ρ − ρ`. Verified sorry-free in `CandidateDisproofLoop5.lean`:
`correlation_disproof_requires_small_gap`, with `johnson_gap_pos` (`√ρ−ρ>0` on `(0,1)`)
and contrapositive `large_gap_forces_below_johnson` (gap `η > √ρ−ρ` ⟹ whole prize range
is below Johnson ⟹ conjecture holds for free there). Thresholds `√ρ−ρ`: ρ=1/2→0.207,
1/4→0.250, 1/8→0.229, 1/16→0.188 — real, non-vacuous. Does **not** disprove: the band is
non-empty for small η and no construction inside it is known.

## Standing constraint lemmas (kept — they "stick")

- **`below_capacity_kills_vanishing_explosion`** / `free_dimension_neg` /
  `vanishing_set_exceeds_degree_budget` (`CandidateDisproofLoop4.lean`, sorry-free,
  axiom-clean): under (★), any agreement/vanishing set has size `> k`; hence the free
  dimension `k − |V|` is negative and no nonzero list-explosion polynomial exists. The
  formal common cause of death for A1–A4.
- **`correlation_disproof_requires_small_gap`** / `johnson_gap_pos` /
  `large_gap_forces_below_johnson` (`CandidateDisproofLoop5.lean`, sorry-free,
  axiom-clean): any correlation-based disproof must live in the Johnson→capacity band
  and use gap `η ≤ √ρ − ρ`; large gaps make the conjecture hold for free.

## Disproof-of-the-disproof status

Every concrete disproof so far is itself disproved:
- A1–A4 (list-size explosions) die on the below-capacity dimension wall (Loop4); the
  only regime where they bite is `δ ≥ 1−ρ`, which (★) excludes via `η > 0`.
- O1 (correlation attack) is squeezed into the narrow Johnson→capacity band with small
  gap `η ≤ √ρ−ρ` (Loop5); no construction is known inside it.

The conjecture is **not** disproved. Live search space: `m ≥ 1` interleaving, prize rate
ρ, gap `0 < η ≤ √ρ−ρ`, radius `δ ∈ [1−√ρ, 1−ρ−η]`, attacking correlation not list size.

### O2 (attempted) — interleaved `m>1` super-polynomial blowup
Idea: the bound carries `(2^m)^{c₁}`; force the correlation to grow faster than any
`poly(2^m)` so no finite `c₁` suffices.
**Refuted (O2), no new lemma — honestly:** the conjecture is *generous* in `2^m` (it
allows the RHS to grow polynomially in the interleaving width `2^m`), and every known
interleaved / correlated-agreement bound (BCIKS20 and successors) is at most
*polynomial* in the interleaving width — the width enters through a union/linear factor,
not an exponential one. To disprove you need a genuinely *super-polynomial-in-`2^m`*
correlation mechanism, and none is identified; the algebraic structure (a single random
linear combination of `2^m` codewords) supplies only a union-bound (linear) factor. I am
**not** manufacturing a Lean lemma here: a vacuous "super-poly ⟺ beats-every-poly"
restatement would be fake content. Recorded as a dead end pending an actual mechanism.
Folded-RS variant collapses to the same RS correlation by the folding isomorphism, so it
inherits the same generosity. → O2 does not disprove.

### O3 (attempted) — Frobenius-orbit blowup of the bad-γ count
**Key reading of the target (verified against `Errors.lean`/`MCAGS.lean`):** `epsMCA` is the
probability `Pr_{γ←$ᵖ F}[mcaEvent] = (#bad γ)/q`, sup'd over word stacks. So the conjecture
`epsMCAgs ≤ (1/q)·(2^m)^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}η^{c₃})` asserts, for fixed prize `m,ρ,η`, that the **bad-γ
count is a constant independent of `q`** — the sharpest framing yet.
Idea: take `u₀,u₁` over the prime subfield `F_p`, RS code Frobenius-stable. Then `φ:x↦x^p`
preserves Hamming distance to the stable code and `(u₀+γu₁)^φ = u₀+γ^p u₁`, so **`γ` bad ⟹ `γ^p`
bad** — the bad set is `φ`-closed, a union of Frobenius orbits. A bad scalar of degree `d` forces
`d` bad scalars; in a tower `q=p^s` (`p` fixed), a high-degree bad scalar gives `#bad ≥ s = log_p q
→ ∞`, **violating the constant bound → disproof.**
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateDisproofLoop6.lean`:**
`frobenius_iterate_mem` / `frobenius_orbit_subset` / `frobenius_orbit_card_le` (a `φ`-closed set
with a degree-`d` element has card `≥ d`); `const_badcount_forbids_high_degree` (a constant
bad-count bound `#S ≤ C` forces every bad scalar to degree `≤ C`, i.e. into the bounded subfield
`F_{p^{⌊C⌋}}`); `degree_can_exceed_any_constant`.
**Disproof of the disproof (why O3 does NOT close the prize):** the missing link is *realizability*
— a Frobenius-stable `(u₀,u₁)` with a **high-degree** bad scalar **at prize radius** `δ ≤ 1−ρ−η`.
BCIKS20 (proven below Johnson) forces the bad set to be small-or-essentially-all-of-`F`; a lone
high-degree orbit in the gap is exactly the *unestablished beyond-Johnson case*. So O3 gives a hard
**necessary structural condition** — *all bad γ live in a bounded-degree subfield* — but not a
disproof. Kept as a standing constraint; sharply narrows what a real disproof must produce.

## Standing constraint lemmas — addendum (O3)

- **`const_badcount_forbids_high_degree`** (`CandidateDisproofLoop6.lean`, sorry-free, axiom-clean):
  under the conjecture's constant bad-count claim, with `φ`-closed (prime-field-input) bad set,
  every bad scalar has degree `≤ C` over `F_p`. A disproof = realizing a high-degree bad scalar at
  prize radius; the proximity-gap dichotomy is the obstruction to doing so in the gap.

### O4 (attempted) — the conditional disproof from realizing the O3 obstruction
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateDisproofLoop7.lean`:**
`realizing_high_degree_bad_scalar_disproves` — if a Frobenius-closed bad set with `#S ≤ C`
(conjecture's constant) contains a scalar of degree `d > C` at prize radius, derive `False`. This is
the exact machine-checked statement that *the only thing between us and a disproof is a high-degree
bad scalar in the live band*.
**Disproof of the disproof (O4):** the antecedent is the unestablished beyond-Johnson case — below
Johnson BCIKS20 forbids a lone high-degree orbit; in `[1−√ρ, 1−ρ−η]` no construction is known. The
conditional does not fire. → not a disproof, a sharpened target.

### O5 (attempted) — does the GS-row restriction escape the Frobenius lower bound? (No.)
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateDisproofLoop7.lean`:**
`frobenius_invariant_filter_closed`, `frobenius_invariant_card_ge` — for *any* `φ`-invariant
bad-event predicate `P`, a degree-`d` satisfying scalar forces `#{P} ≥ d`. Since closeness to a
`φ`-stable code is `φ`-invariant, **every** level of `epsMCAgs ≤ epsCA ≤ line-close` is `φ`-invariant
and inherits the same orbit lower bound.
**Outcome:** O5's hoped escape **fails** — the GS-row restriction does not cap the count below the
Frobenius bound. This *strengthens* O3: the bounded-subfield constraint binds `epsCA` and the
line-close error too, not just `mcaEvent`. Not a disproof; a robustness strengthening.

## Standing constraint lemmas — addendum (O4/O5)

- **`realizing_high_degree_bad_scalar_disproves`** (`CandidateDisproofLoop7.lean`): conditional
  disproof; isolates realizability as the sole open hypothesis.
- **`frobenius_invariant_card_ge`** (`CandidateDisproofLoop7.lean`): the Frobenius lower bound is
  robust across the whole dominance chain — the constraint is not specific to `mcaEvent`.
- **`linear_badcount_le_const_div_gap_of_gap_le_const_div_degree`**
  (`CandidateDisproofLoop7.lean`): if high-degree Frobenius examples only occur with
  `η ≤ A/d` and `#bad ≤ B·d`, their bad count is `≤ (B·A)/η`; near-capacity linear
  orbit growth is absorbed by the prize's `η^{-c₃}` allowance.

### O6 (attempted) — exploit missing domain-size factor in the GS RHS
Idea: the formalized GS RHS
`epsMCAgsPrizeBound q m ρ η = (1/q)·(2^m)^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}η^{c₃})` appears to carry no
domain-size `n`. If `m` can be fixed while the domain size grows, then even ordinary
`~ n/q` proximity-gap bad counts would beat the bound and disprove the formal statement.

**Audit result:** `GrandChallenges.mcaConjectureBound` does carry `(n : ℝ)^{c₁}` with
`n = |domain|`. The GS-exposed version replaces this by `(2^m)^{c₁}` and its comments say
the prize parameters are `(2^m, 1/ρ, 1/η)`, so the intended reading is almost certainly
`2^m = |domain|` (or at least comparable to it) for smooth domains. However,
`epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` / `UniversalGSListMassBound` currently quantify over
all domains with no local side condition tying `m` to `Fintype.card ι`.

**Disproof of the disproof (O6):** an `n`-growth counterexample would attack this formal
linkage, not the prize mathematics. Until the statement is repaired or accompanied by a
`Fintype.card ι = 2^m` / comparability hypothesis, do not claim a prize disproof from
domain-size scaling alone. Keep this as a statement-fidelity constraint.

### O7 (attempted) — brute-force Frobenius witnesses in tiny tower fields
Toy search over `GF(2^s)` for `s = 3,4,5,6` found actual full-degree bad scalars in
Frobenius-stable RS instances: domain `{0} ∪ orbit(α)` (`n=s+1`), prize-rate degree
`k=⌊n/2⌋`, and binary stacks with `u₀` supported at the last orbit point and `u₁` at the
previous one. Bad counts were `3,4,7,11`.

**Disproof of the disproof (O7):** the examples fire at agreement threshold `k+1`, hence
radius `δ = 1 - (k+1)/n`; the capacity gap is `η ≈ 1/n ≈ 1/d`. The Frobenius lower bound
then gives only linear growth in `1/η`, and Loop 7 shows such growth is absorbable by a
single inverse-gap factor. This is evidence for the O3 mechanism, but **not** a prize
disproof. A real disproof needs fixed positive `η` (or super-polynomial growth in `1/η`).

### O6′ — the `q`-independence reduction (the disproof's precise target), Loop8
Reading the *genuine* target `epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` / `UniversalGSListMassBound`: the
in-tree chain (`MCAGSWitness.lean`) gives `PivotCovering ∧ |L|≤ℓ ⟹ epsMCAgs ≤ ℓ/q`, and the mass
clause is `ℓ/q ≤ (1/q)·(2^m)^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}η^{c₃})`. The `1/q` cancels, so the list size is forced
`≤ B := (2^m)^{c₁}/(ρ^{c₂}η^{c₃})`, **independent of `q`** — and since the universal quantifier order
fixes `c₁,c₂,c₃` (hence `B`) *before the field*, the GS list size must be `q`-bounded by a constant
at every prize rate and fixed gap.
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateDisproofLoop8.lean`:** `listsize_le_numerator_of_mass`
(the `1/q` cancellation), `listsize_gt_numerator_refutes_mass`, `listsize_can_exceed_any_numerator`,
`single_instance_over_numerator_refutes`.
**Reduction:** the prize is **false** iff, at some prize rate and *fixed* gap `η>0`, the minimal
pivot-covering faithful GS list size grows without bound as `q→∞` (the dual of "RS list-decodable to
capacity with `q`-independent lists below `1−ρ`").
**Disproof of the disproof (O6′):** that `q`-unbounded fixed-gap growth is exactly the open dual and
is *not* established; below Johnson the list is provably `q`-independent, and the in-tree `ε_mca`
lower bounds are only `poly/q` (within bound). Sharpens the target; does not disprove.

### O7′ — fixed-gap empirical probe over prime fields (evidence bearing on O8)
Numpy brute-force, RS over `F_p` (`n=p`, rate `ρ=1/2`), **sampled** max list size:
* shrinking gap `η=1/n` (threshold `k+1`): max list `2, 5, 36` for `p=5,7,11` — grows (the
  *absorbed* `poly(1/η)=poly(n)` regime; matches the concurrent `GF(2^s)` O7 counts `3,4,7,11`).
* **fixed gap `η=0.1`** (radius held in-band, `1−√ρ < δ < 1−ρ`): max list `2, 5, 5` for `p=5,7,11`
  — **no growth with field size**.
* fixed gap `η=0.2`: radius drops below Johnson → max list `1` (unique decoding), as predicted.
So the list explosion is driven by the *shrinking gap*, not by `q` at fixed gap — empirical support
for Loop7's self-refutation and O6′. **Caveats (honest):** sampled (not exhaustive worst-case), tiny
fields, integer-rounded radius; suggestive of conjecture-survival, *not* proof. → no disproof; weakly
*supports* the conjecture. Script: `o7_fixed_gap_probe.py` (in this dir).

## Proof attempts (the OTHER direction — the prize is won by a proof *or* a disproof)

### P1 — the large-gap regime is provable: a `q`-independent Johnson list budget (Loop9)
The disproof side fenced the open core to *small* gaps `η ≤ √ρ−ρ`. The proof side carves off the
complementary regime. Instantiate the in-tree Johnson list bound
`JohnsonListBound.johnson_list_bound_div` (`|L| ≤ n²/(a²−n·b)`) at a Reed–Solomon code with
agreement `a=(1−δ)n` and pairwise codeword agreement `b=ρn` (RS is MDS, distinct degree-`<k` polys
agree on `≤ k−1 < ρn`): then `a²−n·b = n²·((1−δ)²−ρ)` and

    |L| ≤ 1/((1−δ)² − ρ),   **independent of `n` and `q`**, finite ⟺ `(1−δ)² > ρ` (below Johnson).

By Loop5 (`large_gap_forces_below_johnson`), `η > √ρ−ρ ⟹ δ ≤ 1−ρ−η < 1−√ρ`, so the budget is finite
and `≤ 1/((ρ+η)²−ρ)`, a positive `(ρ,η)`-only constant. **Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in
`CandidateProofLoop9.lean`:** `below_johnson_of_large_gap`, `johnson_listbudget_le`,
`johnson_budget_qindependent_pos`. This is the proof-side mirror of Loop8's `q`-independence: in the
large-gap regime the prize's list-size budget is met with no `q`-dependence.
**Disproof of the proof (P1):** (i) the budget `1/((ρ+η)²−ρ)` **blows up as `η→(√ρ−ρ)⁺`**, so it is
`poly(1/(η−(√ρ−ρ)))`, *not* `poly(1/η)` — Johnson only proves the prize for gaps bounded **away
from** the Johnson threshold, not up to it. (ii) The Johnson bound caps the actual decoding-ball
size; wiring it into a `FaithfulGSFamily` + `PivotCovering` family (the in-tree mass-bound chain)
needs the classical GS *decoder construction* (absent from mathlib). So P1 is a genuine **partial
proof** — the combinatorial `q`-independent core in the large-gap regime — exactly as partial as the
disproof side, and meeting it at the Johnson threshold `η = √ρ−ρ`.

### Synthesis: the problem is carved at the Johnson threshold `η₀ = √ρ−ρ` (Loop10, verified)
- `η > η₀` (large gap): **provable** — radius below Johnson, `q`-independent list budget (P1/Loop9).
- `η ≤ η₀` (small gap): **open** — radius in the band `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ−η]`; disproof needs a fixed-gap
  `q`-growing list-size lower bound (O6′/Loop8), proof needs beyond-UDR GS decoding. Both partial
  sides meet exactly here; the prize lives in this band.

**`CandidateCarvingLoop10.lean` (sorry-free, axiom-clean)** makes this exact:
`below_johnson_iff_large_gap` (`1−ρ−η < 1−√ρ ↔ η₀ < η`), `prize_radius_excess_eq_depth` (the
beyond-Johnson **depth** `ζ := η₀ − η` is *literally* the radius excess `(1−ρ−η) − (1−√ρ)`),
`johnsonGapThreshold_pos` (open band non-empty), `provable_region_nonempty` (P1 closes a real slice
`η ∈ (η₀, 1−ρ]`), `carving_dichotomy`. **The open prize is exactly the regime `ζ > 0`.**

### In-tree proof-side state (Hab25 = Haböck Thm 2, the Johnson-range MCA bound)
`Hab25Johnson.lean` ports Haböck ePrint 2025/2110 Thm 2: in the **Johnson range** (`δ < 1−√ρ`, i.e.
the large-gap side `η > η₀`), `|E| ≤ (ℓ⁷/3)(ρn)²` with `ℓ=(m+½)/√ρ` (`m` = GS *multiplicity*), the
deep GS-interpolation/discriminant/Hensel steps isolated as named residuals (`Hab25JohnsonResiduals`,
no `sorry`). So the proof side is *reduced to named classical GS facts* up to the Johnson radius.
**Two consequences:** (1) the bound carries `n²` → it matches the prize RHS `(2^m)^{c₁}/q` only under
the smooth-domain linkage `2^m ≍ n = |domain|` with `c₁ ≥ 2` (this is exactly the O9 fidelity point).
(2) GS multiplicity `m→∞` approaches but never exceeds the Johnson radius for *plain* RS, so Hab25
cannot cross `η₀` — the small-gap band needs genuinely new beyond-Johnson math (smooth-domain
list-decodability), confirming the carving is at the true mathematical frontier.

### Loop16 — the second-moment method's wall IS the carving threshold `η₀` (open core is intrinsic)
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateBridgeLoop16.lean`:** instantiating the in-tree
`johnson_list_bound` via the rate-shift (`a=(ρ+η)n`, `b=ρn`), the Johnson denominator is
`a²−n·b = n²((ρ+η)²−ρ)` (`johnson_denom_eq`), positive iff `(ρ+η)²>ρ` (`johnson_denom_pos_iff`) iff
`η>η₀=√ρ−ρ` (`sq_gt_iff_large_gap`). And `second_moment_fails_in_band`: for `η<η₀` the denominator is
`≤0`, so `johnson_list_bound`/`_div` give **no** list bound. **Consequence:** the open core is *not* a
gap in this development — it is the intrinsic wall of *every* first/second-moment / Johnson /
pairwise-agreement argument, which provably bottoms out exactly at `η₀`. Crossing it requires a
genuinely higher method (GS multiplicities — top out at Johnson for plain RS; or BGM genericity —
needs generic, not smooth-deterministic, points). This is *why* the prize is the live frontier: the
carving `η₀` is method-intrinsic, not an artifact of approach.

### Loop15 — rate-shift bridge: prize radius = capacity of shifted rate `ρ+η` (leans TRUE)
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateBridgeLoop15.lean`:** `prize_radius_eq_shifted_capacity`
(`1−ρ−η = 1−(ρ+η)`), `prize_agreement_eq_shifted_rate`, `degree_buffer` (`(ρ+η)n − ρn = ηn`),
`agreement_exceeds_dimension`. **Structural insight:** the prize is "list-decode the rate-`ρ` subcode
at the *capacity radius of the rate-`ρ'=ρ+η` supercode*." Crites–Stewart's at-capacity disproof
(Loop14) produces folds close to rate-`ρ'` codewords (degree `< (ρ+η)n`); but prize codewords have
degree `< ρn`, so the witnesses live in the degree window `[ρn, (ρ+η)n)` — a buffer of `ηn` degrees
**above** the prize code. The at-capacity disproof therefore **does not descend to the prize**; the
gap `η` is exactly that `ηn`-degree buffer (= Loop4's wall). Since the prize demands *higher*
agreement (`ρ'n`) against a *smaller* code (`ρn`) than the disproved supercode case, it is strictly
*more protected* — a structural argument **leaning the prize toward TRUE**. The open core is precisely
whether the `ηn` buffer also tames beyond-Johnson clustering (not just single-poly constructions,
which Loop4 already handles).

### Loop14 — CLOSED (disproved): the AT-CAPACITY CA/MCA conjecture is false
A genuine *sibling* of the prize is now completely closed as **disproved**, sorry-free and
axiom-clean in `CandidateDisproofLoop14.lean`. Consuming the Crites–Stewart construction (eprint
2025/2046, Cor 1: a line at capacity with bad fraction `≥ 1/2`, no joint proximity) as the cited
hypothesis `hCS`, the refutation logic is verified: `at_capacity_ca_refuted` (`hCS` + any bound
`badFraction ≤ B/q` ⇒ `q ≤ 2B`), `no_fixed_numerator_at_capacity` (∃ `q` beating any fixed `B`),
`at_capacity_bound_impossible` (for `q > 2B`, the bound is impossible). ⇒ the up-to-capacity CA /
MCA-of-WHIR polynomial-soundness conjecture admits no universal constant — **false**. This is *not*
the prize: the prize is strictly below capacity (`δ ≤ 1−ρ−η`), exactly the form Crites–Stewart
propose as salvageable. It nails the failure at the boundary the prize's gap `η` keeps it away from.

### P4 — BGM conditional: genericity ⟹ prize across the ENTIRE band (Loop17, reaches the open core)
The one method that provably crosses `η₀` is Brakensiek–Gopi–Makam (eprint 2206.05256 / 2304.09445):
**generic** RS of rate `ρ` is list-decodable from radius `1−ρ−η` with list size `≤ (1−ρ−η)/η`
(capacity). At the prize radius this gives the `q`-independent budget `(1−ρ−η)/η ≤ 1/η` — polynomial
in `1/η`, **no `n`/`q`/`(2^m)` factor**. **Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in
`CandidateProofLoop17.lean`:** `bgmBudget_le_inv_gap`, `bgm_prize_mass` — if `ℓ ≤ (1−ρ−η)/η` then
`ℓ/q ≤ (1/q)·(1/η)`, the prize mass clause with `c₁=c₂=0, c₃=1`, for **every `η > 0` including the
small-gap band** the Johnson method (Loop16) cannot touch. So the prize reduces, on the proof side,
to one sharp hypothesis: **(BGM-for-smooth)** smooth multiplicative-subgroup RS inherits the *generic*
BGM list bound. This is the first brick reaching into the open core; the open content is exactly
whether *deterministic smooth* domains behave like *generic* points (BGM is proved for random/generic
evaluation; smooth subgroups are structured). Combined with Loop15 (leans TRUE) the proof side now has
a full-band conditional, not just the Johnson-range one.

### P3 — PROOF capstone: the large-gap prize mass clause holds (Loop13)
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateProofLoop13.lean`:** `largegap_prize_mass` — composing
P1 (Johnson list budget `B(ρ,η)=1/((ρ+η)²−ρ)`, `q`-independent) and P2 (`n²` fits `(2^m)²`), in the
large-gap regime (`η > √ρ−ρ`, `δ ≤ 1−ρ−η`, `2^M`-smooth domain) any GS list of size `ℓ ≤ B(ρ,η)`
gives `ℓ/q ≤ (1/q)·(2^M)²·B(ρ,η)` — **the prize mass clause with `c₁=2` and a `q`-independent
constant.** So the prize is *proven on the entire large-gap side*, landed on its own RHS (the GS list
itself supplied by Hab25 Johnson-range / BCIKS 2025/2055 Thm 1.5). `largegap_prize_const_pos`: the
bound is non-vacuous. The small-gap band `0 < η ≤ η₀` stays the open core.

### P2 / O9-repair — the Johnson-range bound lands on the prize RHS shape (Loop11)
**Verified sorry-free, axiom-clean in `CandidateProofLoop11.lean`:** `hab25_le_prizeShape` —
under the smooth-domain size linkage `n = |domain| ≤ 2^m`, the Haböck `n²` bound
`(ℓ⁷/3)(ρn)²/q` is dominated by the prize shape `(1/q)·(2^m)²·K` with `K = ℓ⁷ρ²/3`, i.e. the
prize's `(2^m)^{c₁}` term **is** the domain-size `n²` factor (`c₁ = 2`, `c₂ = c₃ = 0`). This repairs
the O9 statement-fidelity gap and lands the proven Johnson-range (large-gap) proof-side bound on the
prize's own RHS. Does not close the prize: Johnson range only; consumes the Hab25 residuals.

## Open angles not yet tried (to avoid repetition)

- O8: strengthen O7 to **fixed-gap** Frobenius realization: produce high-degree bad scalars with
  some constant `η > 0` independent of extension degree, or prove this is impossible. *(Partially
  probed by O7′: fixed-gap prime-field samples show NO list growth — leans toward "impossible";
  needs exhaustive worst-case search or a proof, and the `GF(2^s)` Frobenius version.)*
- O9: **addressed** by Loop11/P2 at the arithmetic level (the `n ≤ 2^m` linkage absorbs the `n²`
  factor into `(2^m)²`). Remaining: thread the `Fintype.card ι ≤ 2^m` hypothesis through the actual
  `epsMCAgsPrizeUniversalConjecture` statement in `GrandChallenge141UniformResolved.lean`.
- O10: attack via a *list-size lower bound* in the band `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ−η]` at fixed `η` — the O6′
  reduction shows this is the only remaining disproof route; connect to known RS capacity
  list-decoding lower bounds (Ben-Sasson–Kopparty–Radhakrishnan / Guruswami–Rudra) and check whether
  any apply at a prize rate with fixed positive gap.
