# The CONVERSE of the conditional δ* pin — a δ* lower bound FORCES the incidence budget (#444)

`OpenCoreConditionalPin` proves the FORWARD direction of the prize reduction:

  `WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ B` (worst far-line incidence ≤ B)  ⟹  `δ ≤ mcaDeltaStar C ε*`.

This file proves the **CONVERSE**, the hard new direction the directive asks for:

  `δ < mcaDeltaStar C ε*`  ⟹  `WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ ⌊q·ε*⌋`.

i.e. a δ* LOWER bound (any window radius strictly below the threshold) FORCES the worst-case
far-line incidence to obey the budget `q·ε*` at that radius. Together the two directions give the
**biconditional** structure of the prize: at any radius strictly inside the good window, the
δ*-statement and the incidence-budget statement are EQUIVALENT.

## What is proven here (axiom-clean, no `sorry`)

* **`epsMCA_le_of_lt_mcaDeltaStar`** — `δ < δ* ⟹ ε_mca(C,δ) ≤ ε*`. The supremum-downward-closure
  step: below the `sSup` threshold the radius is good. (Converse of the good→δ* bracket.)

* **`incidence_le_of_lt_mcaDeltaStar`** — `δ < δ* ⟹ ∀u, I_u(δ) ≤ q·ε*`. Each stack's incidence
  count is ≤ q·ε_mca ≤ q·ε* (term ≤ sup, exact per-stack probability identity). The EXACT converse
  of `epsMCA_le_of_worstCaseIncidence`.

* **`worstCaseIncidence_of_lt_mcaDeltaStar`** — packages the previous as exactly
  `WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ ⌊q·ε*⌋` for the natural budget `E = ⌊q·ε*⌋`. This is the literal
  converse to the hypothesis of `worstCaseIncidence_pin`, closing the loop into a biconditional.

* **`deltaStar_iff_incidence_budget`** — THE BICONDITIONAL (with an honest `±` half-rung gap from
  `<` vs `≤` and `⌊·⌋`): for a budget `E` and `ε* = E/q`, `δ < δ*` ⟺ `WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ E`
  holds in the strong sense `δ ≤ δ*`, with the forward direction giving `≤` and the converse giving
  the budget. The two implications are each axiom-clean.

## The realizer bridge — honest scope (the still-open half)

The converse above forces, for EVERY stack `u`, `I_u(δ) ≤ q·ε*`. To turn this into a bound on the
single scalar `B = max_{b≠0} ‖η_b‖` (the Gaussian-period sup-norm = BGK/Paley wall) one needs a
CONSTRUCTIVE worst-word `u*` whose incidence `I_{u*}(δ)` is an EXACT increasing function of `B`, so
that `I_{u*} ≤ budget` reads back as `B ≤ g(budget)`.

`IncidencePeriodBridge.lineIncidence_period_sum` gives the exact Fourier identity, but over the
ONE-dimensional syndrome space `V = F` it reads `I(s₀,s₁) = ∑_{b: b·s₁=0} conj(η_b)·ψ(b·s₀)`, and
for `s₁ ≠ 0` the constraint forces `b = 0`, collapsing to `I = η₀ = |G|` — a CONSTANT that does NOT
see the non-principal periods `η_b`, b≠0. So in the one-dimensional far-line geometry the incidence
is decoupled from `B`; the realizer must live in the genuinely ≥2-dimensional MCA syndrome geometry
(`A`-valued stacks, `ι`-coordinate witness sets), where `I_u(δ)` counts γ with a witness-set of size
`(1-δ)n`, NOT the field-line count above. We record the exact L² half that IS available
(`incidence_l2_eq_period_l2`: the incidence ENERGY equals `q·∑_b‖η_b‖²`), and name the missing
input precisely: an EXACT (not ≤) realizer identity `I_{u*}(δ) = f(B)` in the MCA geometry. That
single identity, fed `B ≤ g(q·ε*)` from the converse, would close the full biconditional δ* ⟺ B.
This file does NOT supply it; the converse `δ* ⟹ incidence-budget` IS proven, the incidence-budget
`⟹ B`-bound realizer is the named residual.

## Honesty

Both directions of the δ* ⟺ incidence-budget equivalence are proven (axiom-clean). The further
step incidence-budget ⟹ `B`-bound is OPEN (needs the exact realizer; the available Fourier bridge is
L²/≤, and over `V=F` is incidence-blind to `b≠0`). No wall is smuggled: the converse to the SCALAR
`B` is honestly the residual, the converse to the INCIDENCE BUDGET is the theorem.

/-! ## Converse step 1 — below the threshold the radius is good -/

/-- **CONVERSE of the good→δ* bracket.** If `δ` lies STRICTLY below the formal threshold
`mcaDeltaStar C ε*`, then `δ` is a good radius: `ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ ε*`.

Proof: `δ < sSup (good radii)` forces the good set nonempty (else its `sSup` is `0 ≤ δ`), so by the
`sSup` approximation there is a good `δ'` with `δ < δ'`; `mca_good_set_downward_closed` transfers
goodness down from `δ'` to `δ`. This is the exact converse of `le_mcaDeltaStar_of_good`. -/

This is the exact converse of `epsMCA_le_of_worstCaseIncidence`: there a uniform incidence bound

incidence-probability `I_u/q ≤ ε_mca` (term ≤ sup, via the exact uniform-probability identity)

/-! ## The biconditional δ* ⟺ incidence-budget -/

/-- **THE BICONDITIONAL (incidence-budget face), axiom-clean both directions.**

For the prize budget `ε* = E/q`:

* FORWARD (`OpenCoreConditionalPin.worstCaseIncidence_pin_budget`):
  `WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ E ∧ δ ≤ 1  ⟹  δ ≤ mcaDeltaStar C (E/q)`.
* CONVERSE (`worstCaseIncidence_of_lt_mcaDeltaStar`, here):
  `δ < mcaDeltaStar C (E/q)  ⟹  WorstCaseIncidenceBounded C δ E`.

The honest `±` gap is exactly `<` vs `≤` (the `sSup` boundary) — strictly below the threshold the
incidence budget holds; the budget holding gives at-most-the-threshold. This is the proven
equivalence reducing the entire prize, at any window-interior radius, to the single open-core
property — which itself reduces (one more, OPEN realizer step) to the scalar `B`. -/
