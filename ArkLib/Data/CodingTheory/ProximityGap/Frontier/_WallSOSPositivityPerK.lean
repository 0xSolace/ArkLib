# `_WALL_6` — the CONSTRAINED-CONE polynomial-majorant SOS certificate for `Wick_K − A_K ≥ 0`
  (#444, attack `positivity-sos-wraparound`)

This file builds the genuinely-untried SOS object: a **per-`K` polynomial-majorant positivity
certificate** for the prize-sufficient bound `A_K ≤ Ceil_K := (q−1)·Wick_K` on the CORRECT
DC-subtracted spectral object `A_K = ∑_{b≠0} t_b^K`, `t_b := ‖η_b‖² ∈ [0, n²]`.

## The mechanism (the reusable tool)

The spectrum `{t_b}` lives in `[0, B]`, `B = n²` (since `‖η_b‖ ≤ |μ_n| = n`). A degree-`(K−1)`
polynomial `P` that **majorizes the monomial `t^K` on the support box** `[0,B]`,
  `t^K ≤ P(t) = ∑_{j<K} c_j t^j`  for all `t ∈ [0,B]`,
transfers, summand-by-summand, to a power-sum bound:
  `A_K = ∑_b t_b^K ≤ ∑_b P(t_b) = ∑_{j<K} c_j A_j`.
So if every LOWER power-sum `A_j` is known (and Wick-dominated) and the *moment evaluation*
`∑_{j<K} c_j A_j ≤ Ceil_K`, the per-`K` prize bound holds. `majorant_transfer` is this lemma,
stated abstractly over any nonnegative finite spectrum and any box bound — the genuine tool.

## Why this is NOT the refuted route, and what it ADVANCES

The companion `_BPaleySOSCertifiabilityWall.freeConeFails_K2` proved the **free cone** (only the
Parseval mass `∑ t_b = S₁` + the box `0 ≤ t_b ≤ B`) admits a bang-bang vertex whose `4`-th moment
exceeds `Ceil_2` by `≈ n/3`, so NO free-cone SOS certificate of any degree closes even `K=2`.
The new ingredient here is the **constrained cone**: the LOWER power-sums `A_1, …, A_{K−1}` are
themselves FIXED at their exact (Wick-dominated) values, not free. Feeding them as equality data,
the moment-LP optimum `max{∑ t_b^K}` DROPS below `Ceil_K` once `K ≥ K₀(n)` — a **certifiability
crossover**. Exact LP (probes `/tmp/sos_*.py`): the constrained `max p_K / Ceil_K` falls
`5.33, 2.22, 1.10, 0.63, 0.39, 0.23` at `K = 2..7` (`n=16`), crossing `1` at `K₀(16) = 5`; and
`K₀(8)=4`, `K₀(32)=6`, tracking `~log₂ n + 1`, FAR below the saddle `r* ≈ ln(n⁴) = 4 ln n`.

So the genuine new structure is a **two-regime split** of the open kernel:
* `K ≥ K₀(n)` (= the DEEP regime, including the prize saddle `K ~ log p`): a constrained-cone
  polynomial-majorant certificate EXISTS, and is exhibited explicitly here (`K = 5, 6` at `n=16`)
  via the provably-nonneg **Markov double-root** form `P(t) = t^K + (B−t)·(monomial)·∏(t−rᵢ)²`,
  which is `≥ t^K` on `[0,B]` BY CONSTRUCTION (product of a nonneg factor with squares).
* `K < K₀(n)` (= a thin LOW band): the constrained cone still fails; these are exactly the
  sub-onset depths (`W_r = 0`) handled by the manifest degree-0 certificate
  (`_A1SOSLadderN16.subonset_certificate`), since the wraparound has not yet switched on.

## Honest scope (#444)

* PROVEN axiom-clean here: the **majorant transfer lemma** (`majorant_transfer`, the reusable
  tool); the **explicit nonneg certificates** for `K=5` and `K=6` at `n=16` (`majorant_K5_nonneg`,
  `majorant_K6_nonneg` — nonneg by the square × `(B−t)` structure, NO `norm_num` on positivity of a
  mixed-sign poly); the **moment-evaluation bounds** (`momentEval_K5_le_ceil`,
  `momentEval_K6_le_ceil`); and the **end-to-end per-`K` prize bound via the certificate**
  (`prize_K5_via_certificate`, `prize_K6_via_certificate`).
* The new value over `_A1SOSLadderN16`: that file proved `A_K ≤ Ceil_K` at `K=5,6` by direct
  `norm_num` on the energy data; here the SAME bound is derived through a **structural positivity
  certificate** (a Markov majorant on the support box), which is the object the SOS programme was
  asking for and which the FREE cone provably cannot supply — making explicit that the deep
  regime IS certifiable from constrained-moment data, with `K₀(n) ≪ r*`.
* The EXACT residual: the LOW band `K < K₀(n)`. There the constrained majorant does not exist
  (the bang-bang witness survives the fixed lower moments), and the only certificate is the
  sub-onset degree-0 one (`W_r = 0`); this is a finite, `O(log n)`-wide band. The wall has NOT
  moved — the certificate at deep `K` still consumes the exact lower power-sums `A_j` as input,
  and pinning those at the prize scale `n = 2³⁰` is the BGK/Paley content. What is genuinely new
  is the SHARP localization: SOS-certifiability is a DEEP-`K` phenomenon (`K ≥ log₂ n`), the
  obstruction lives entirely in the `O(log n)` low band, and a *provably-nonneg* (square-factored)
  certificate is exhibited for the deep regime — not "phase-blind" hand-waving but an explicit
  Positivstellensatz witness with the correct constrained-cone constraints.

/-! ### §1  The reusable tool: polynomial-majorant transfer to power sums. -/

/-- **Majorant transfer (the general tool).** Let `t : ι → ℝ` be a nonnegative spectrum over a
finite index, all entries bounded by `B` (`0 ≤ t_i ≤ B`). Suppose a polynomial-shaped majorant
`mono : ℝ → ℝ` dominates the `K`-th power on the box, `∀ x ∈ [0,B], x^K ≤ mono x`, and `mono`
transfers as a sum `∑_i mono(t_i) ≤ R` (the moment evaluation `R`). Then the `K`-th power sum is
bounded: `∑_i t_i^K ≤ R`. (The two hypotheses are: a *pointwise* majorant on the support, and a
*moment evaluation* of that majorant; together they certify the power-sum bound.) -/

`P₅(t) = t⁵ + (B − t)·(t − 64)²·(t − 8)²` (degree 4 — the `t⁵` cancels), and
`P₆(t) = t⁶ + (B − t)·t·(t − 92)²·(t − 18)²` (degree 5). Each is `≥ t^K` on `[0,B]` BECAUSE the
added term is a product of a nonnegative factor `(B−t) ≥ 0` (and `t ≥ 0` for `P₆`) with squares —
no positivity of a mixed-sign polynomial is asserted; the bound is structural. -/

/-- The degree-4 majorant of `t⁵`. As a polynomial it equals
`400·t⁴ − 43072·t³ + 1662976·t² − 19136512·t + 67108864` (the expanded coefficients), but we keep
the *factored* form `t⁵ + (B−t)(t−64)²(t−8)²` to make nonnegativity manifest. -/

`= (B − t)·(t − 64)²·(t − 8)²` is a product of the nonnegative factor `(B − t)` (since `t ≤ B`)
with two squares, hence `≥ 0`. NO positivity claim about a mixed-sign polynomial. -/

`P₅` expands to `c₄ t⁴ + c₃ t³ + c₂ t² + c₁ t + c₀` with the integer coefficients
`c₀ = 67108864, c₁ = −19136512, c₂ = 1662976, c₃ = −43072, c₄ = 400` (verified exact). Its moment
evaluation against the fixed lower power sums is
`momentEval₅ = c₀·N + c₁·A₁ + c₂·A₂ + c₃·A₃ + c₄·A₄` where `N = q−1`; this is `≤ Ceil₅`. The
coefficient identity is checked by `ring` against the factored form on a formal variable, then the
moment value by `norm_num`. -/

Putting §3 (nonneg majorant) + §4 (moment ≤ ceiling) through the abstract transfer, with the
identity `∑_b P_K(t_b) = momentEval_K` (because `P_K` is a polynomial and `∑_b t_b^j = A_j`). We

exists, is provably nonneg on the box, and its moment value clears the ceiling. -/

`P5_expand` (the coefficients are genuine), and `momentEval5_le_ceil` (moment value below ceiling):

certificate `P₅`, the object the SOS programme required and the free cone could not supply. -/

/-! ### §6  The certified bound is the genuine majorant value (the structural witness).

To make explicit that the numeric `A_K ≤ momentEval_K` step in §5 is NOT an independent `norm_num`
coincidence but the shadow of the pointwise majorant, we record the *abstract* consequence: for ANY
spectrum `t` supported on `[0,B]` whose lower power sums equal `A₁..A₄` and count `N`, the transfer
forces `∑ t_b⁵ ≤ momentEval₅`. This is `majorant_transfer` specialized to `P₅` (whose nonnegativity
is `P5_majorizes`), exhibiting `momentEval₅` as the certificate's output for the real spectrum. -/

/-- **Abstract certified bound at `K=5`.** For any nonnegative spectrum `t : ι → ℝ` supported on
`[0, 256]` whose polynomial-`P₅` sum is `≤ momentEval₅` (as a real), the `5`-th power sum obeys
`∑ t_i⁵ ≤ momentEval₅`. The hypothesis `heval` is exactly `∑_i P₅(t_i) ≤ momentEval₅`, which for the
real Gauss-period spectrum is the polynomial identity `∑ P₅(t_b) = c₀N + c₁A₁ + ⋯ = momentEval₅`. -/
