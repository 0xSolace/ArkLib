# A3 — Linear-form decoupling of the Gauss period (#444)

The proximity-prize floor `M = max_{b≠0}|η_b| ≤ C√(n log m)` reduces (the arcsine-iid framing,
`_ArcsineIIDFraming`) to the sub-Gaussianity of the **Gauss period**

  `η_b = ∑_{k=1}^{n/2} Y_k(b)`,   `Y_k(b) = 2·cos(2π·b·x_k/p)`,

where `x_1,…,x_{n/2}` are the `n/2` antipodal-pair representatives of the `2`-power subgroup `μ_n`.

## The decisive structural fact (machine-verified, `phase_independence.py`)

The phases `θ_k(b) = 2π·b·x_k/p` are a **RANK-1 LINEAR FUNCTION of `b`**: `θ_k(b) = b·(2π x_k/p)`.
So as `b` ranges over the `m = (p−1)/n` frequencies, `η_b` traces a **`1`-parameter family** — the
sup over `b` is the **sup-norm of a linear form** / a degree-`1` exponential sum over the dilated
set `{b·x_k : k}`.

The `n/2` contributions are therefore **NOT jointly independent** (a rank-`1` family has only one
degree of freedom). The naive iid framing (`_ArcsineIIDFraming`) is only a *moment match*. The REAL
mechanism is **low-order equidistribution of the linear form**: the contributions are
*pairwise* near-orthogonal (`max|Corr(Y_j,Y_k)| = 0.045` over `b`), and the sum concentrates
sub-Gaussianly (`E[η⁶]/E[η²]³ = 12.3 < ` Gaussian `15`). This file builds the **decoupling /
Fourier framework** that turns *pair/triple equidistribution* — not joint independence — into the
sub-Gaussian bound.

## The Fourier dictionary (this file, axiom-clean)

Average over the `m` frequencies `b ∈ B` is the linear functional `avg_B f = (1/|B|)∑_{b∈B} f(b)`.
The framework rests on three exact identities + one inequality, all over `ℝ`:

* **`avgCos_eq_discrepancy`** — `avg_B (cos(b·α)) = D(α)`, the **equidistribution discrepancy** of
  the dilated phase `{b·α : b∈B}`: it is `0` exactly when `{b·α}` is balanced (the linear form
  equidistributes). This is the elementary Weyl bridge: a non-trivial frequency's average IS its
  discrepancy.

* **`secondMoment_eq_diag_plus_pairDiscrepancy`** — the **decoupling identity for the variance**:
  ```
  avg_B (η_b²) = ∑_k avg_B(Y_k²) + ∑_{j≠k} avg_B(Y_j Y_k)
              = (diagonal proxy)   +  (∑ PAIR discrepancies).
  ```
  The diagonal `avg_B(Y_k²) = avg_B(4cos²) = 2 + 2·D(2x_k)` has the **constant sub-Gaussian proxy
  `2`** plus its own self-pair discrepancy; the off-diagonal `avg_B(Y_j Y_k) = 2D(x_j−x_k)+2D(x_j+x_k)`
  is the **pair discrepancy** of the difference/sum set. So the variance proxy is `V = n` EXACTLY in
  the limit where every pair `{b·(x_j±x_k)}` equidistributes (`D = 0`) — the antipodal `μ_n` set is
  Sidon-except-negation, so `x_j±x_k ≠ 0` for `j≠k`, and the discrepancies vanish in the ideal limit.

* **`cos_sq_avg_identity`** — the trig kernel `4cos²θ = 2 + 2cos(2θ)` (the diagonal proxy `2` is the
  `θ`-free term; `2cos(2θ)` is the doubled-frequency discrepancy).

* **`besselI0Two_le_exp_sq` / per-phase MGF** — each `|Y_k| ≤ 2` has the **Bessel MGF**
  `E[e^{Y_k y}] = I₀(2y) ≤ exp(y²)` (sub-Gaussian proxy `2`, the char-0 `_CharZeroMGFBesselBound`);
  re-derived self-contained here as `cosh_two_cos_le_exp` (`cosh(2y cosθ) ≤ exp(2y²)` — the *uniform*
  per-phase MGF bound that does not even need averaging).

## The decoupling theorem and the named residual

* **`PairEquidistributed`** (the NAMED EQUIDISTRIBUTION RESIDUAL) — the precise low-order hypothesis:
  the dilated difference/sum sets `{b·(x_j±x_k) : b∈B}` are **`δ`-equidistributed in pairs**, i.e.
  every pair discrepancy is `≤ δ`. (Triples enter only through the `6`-th moment refinement; pairs
  control the variance, which is what the sub-Gaussian floor needs.)

* **`subGaussian_supNorm_of_pairEquidist`** — the **decoupling capstone**: per-phase Bessel
  sub-Gaussianity (`cosh(Y_k y) ≤ exp(σ² y²/2)`, `σ²=2`) composed over the `m = n/2` phases gives the
  period MGF `cosh(η_b y) ≤ exp((n + Δ)·y²/2)` with `Δ` the **summed pair-discrepancy correction**;
  under `δ`-pair-equidistribution `Δ ≤ (matchings)·δ → 0`, so the variance proxy is `V = n + o(n)` and
  the Chernoff max bound delivers `M ≤ √(2(n+Δ)·log m)`. With `Δ = 0` (ideal pair-equidistribution)
  this is **exactly the prize floor** `√(2n log m)`.

## Honest scope

The per-phase MGF bound and the variance-decoupling *identity* are **fully proven, axiom-clean** —
this is the genuine content of "the rank-1 sup-norm is governed by pair/triple equidistribution, not
joint independence". The **named open residual** is `PairEquidistributed` at the prize-binding depth:
that the dilated `{b·(x_j±x_k)}` actually equidistribute uniformly over the `m` frequencies with
`δ → 0`. This is the **same wall** as faces 3↔4 (incomplete character sums / BGK), now stated as a
*pair-level* equidistribution discrepancy rather than an additive-energy bound — a strictly weaker-
looking but provably-equivalent surface. We do NOT discharge it; we name it and prove the decoupling
machinery it feeds. Issue #444.

/-- **The variance decoupling identity (the heart of A3).** Average the *square* of the period
`η_b = ∑_k Y_k(b)`, `Y_k(b) = 2cos(φ_k b)`, over the frequencies. Expanding the square and using
linearity + the trig kernels, the second moment splits into a **diagonal** (the per-phase proxies)
and an **off-diagonal pair-discrepancy** sum:

```
avg_B(η²) = ∑_k avg_B(Y_k²)  +  ∑_{j≠k} avg_B(Y_j Y_k).
```

We prove the exact algebraic split (`avg` of `(∑Y)²` = `∑ avg(Y²) + ∑_{j≠k} avg(Y_j Y_k)`); combined
with `cos_sq_avg_identity` (`avg Y_k² = 2 + 2D(2x_k)`) and `cos_prod_avg_identity`
(`avg Y_jY_k = 2D(x_j−x_k)+2D(x_j+x_k)`) this is the statement that **the variance proxy is the sum of
the constant proxies `2·(n/2) = n` plus the pair-discrepancy correction**. The correction vanishes iff

/-! ## §5. The named equidistribution residual and the decoupling capstone. -/

/-- **The pair-equidistribution residual (the NAMED OPEN HYPOTHESIS, the honest open content).**

`PairEquidistributed φ δ` asserts that for a family of phase maps `φ : Fin m → B → ℝ` (the dilated
antipodal phases `φ_k(b) = 2π·b·x_k/p`), every **pair difference/sum discrepancy** is `≤ δ` in
absolute value:

> `∀ j k, |D(φ_j − φ_k)| ≤ δ  ∧  |D(φ_j + φ_k)| ≤ δ  ∧  |D(2φ_k)| ≤ δ`.

This is the precise **low-order equidistribution** statement: the dilated difference/sum sets
`{b·(x_j ± x_k) : b∈B}` (and doubled `{b·2x_k}`) are `δ`-equidistributed over the `m = (p−1)/n`
frequencies. By `secondMoment_decoupling` + the diagonal/off-diagonal identities, this controls the
variance: `avg_B(η²) ≤ n + (m + 2·C(m,2))·2δ = n + O(m²δ)`. At the prize binding depth the residual
is `δ → 0` (the difference/sum sets are Sidon-except-negation, `x_j±x_k ≠ 0`, so they generate the
full group and *should* equidistribute) — this is the **same wall** as the incomplete-character-sum /
BGK face, restated at the *pair* level. We name it; we do not discharge it for the prize regime. -/
def PairEquidistributed {m : ℕ} (φ : Fin m → B → ℝ) (δ : ℝ) : Prop :=

  (∀ j k : Fin m, |discrepancy (fun b => φ j b + φ k b)| ≤ δ) ∧
  (∀ k : Fin m, |discrepancy (fun b => 2 * φ k b)| ≤ δ)

/-- **The variance proxy from pair-equidistribution (the decoupling output).** Under
`PairEquidistributed φ δ`, the averaged second moment of the period `η_b = ∑_k 2cos(φ_k b)` is bounded
by the **prize proxy `2m = n` plus an `O(m²δ)` correction**:

> `avg_B(η²) ≤ 2m + 2δ·(m + m(m−1)·2) = 2m + 2δ·m·(2m−1)`.

The leading term `2m = n` is the exact prize variance proxy (the constant per-phase proxy `2` summed
over the `m = n/2` antipodal phases); the correction is the summed pair discrepancy, which `→ 0` as
the difference/sum sets equidistribute (`δ → 0`). This is the precise sense in which **the variance is

/-- **The matching LOWER companion to `variance_le_of_pairEquidist` (two-sided variance control).**
The same pair-equidistribution residual `PairEquidistributed φ δ` that caps the variance proxy from
ABOVE also pins it from BELOW: the second moment cannot drop more than the same `O(m²δ)` correction
below the prize proxy `2m = n`:

> `avg_B(η²) ≥ 2m − 2δ·m·(2m−1)`.

Proof mirrors the upper bound: the decoupling identity is an EQUALITY, the diagonal proxy is
`2 + 2D(2x_k) ≥ 2 − 2δ` (using the lower half of `|D|≤δ`), and each off-diagonal pair term is
`2D(x_j−x_k)+2D(x_j+x_k) ≥ −4δ`. Together with the upper bound this gives the two-sided statement
`|avg_B(η²) − 2m| ≤ 2δ·m·(2m−1)`, i.e. **the variance proxy equals the prize floor `n` up to the
exact summed pair-discrepancy correction** — so `δ → 0` forces `avg_B(η²) = 2m = n` from BOTH sides,
not merely `≤`. (This matters for any application that needs a variance LOWER bound — e.g. a
Plancherel/anti-concentration floor on the typical frequency — which the one-sided
`variance_le_of_pairEquidist` cannot supply.) NO CORE/cancellation/capacity claim: this is the
symmetric arithmetic of the same named residual, not a discharge of it. -/

/-- **Two-sided variance control from pair-equidistribution** (`variance_le_` ∧ `variance_ge_`).
The averaged second moment is within `2δ·m·(2m−1)` of the exact prize proxy `2m = n`:
`|avg_B(η²) − 2m| ≤ 2δ·m·(2m−1)`. So at `δ = 0` the variance proxy is EXACTLY `2m` (not merely
bounded by it). This is the precise two-sided sense in which pair-equidistribution pins the variance. -/

/-- **The decoupling capstone: the sub-Gaussian sup-norm from pair-equidistribution.** Under the
pair-equidistribution residual `PairEquidistributed φ δ` and the per-phase Bessel MGF (proven, no
independence), the period's symmetric MGF is dominated by the sub-Gaussian envelope with the
**decoupled variance proxy `V = 2m + correction`** (the uniform `prod_cosh_le_exp` already gives proxy
`2m = n` per frequency; pair-equidistribution is what certifies this is the *true* proxy and not a
lossy worst-case). Feeding `cosh(η_b y) ≤ K·exp(V y²/2)` into the Chernoff/Cramér bound
(`_D2LargeDeviationRateFunction.chernoff_bound`, here re-stated as the clean saddle consequence)
gives the prize floor

> `M = max_{b≠0} |η_b| ≤ √(2·V·log K)`,   `V = n` (`δ → 0`),  `K = m`,

i.e. `M ≤ √(2n log m)`. We prove the **saddle consequence** axiom-clean: from
`M·y ≤ log K + V y²/2 ∀ y ≥ 0` (the log of the sub-Gaussian MGF at the binding frequency) the optimal
`y* = M/V` yields `M ≤ √(2 V log K)`. The variance input `V` is supplied by
`variance_le_of_pairEquidist` (`V = 2m + O(m²δ) → n`); the MGF envelope by `prod_cosh_le_exp`. The
NAMED OPEN INPUT is `PairEquidistributed` at the prize-binding depth. -/

/-- **End-to-end (the prize floor in the ideal-equidistribution limit).** Specializing the capstone
to the **exactly-equidistributed** case `δ = 0` (`PairEquidistributed φ 0`): the variance proxy is
*exactly* `V = 2m = n` (`variance_le_of_pairEquidist` with `δ=0` gives `avg η² ≤ 2m`), and so a period
whose binding-frequency MGF obeys `M y ≤ log m + (2m) y²/2` satisfies the **prize floor**

> `M ≤ √(2·(2m)·log m) = √(2n·log m)`,   `n = 2m`.

This is the clean statement of "pair-equidistribution ⟹ the prize". The hypothesis `δ = 0` is the
ideal limit of the named residual; the honest open core is exactly that the prize-binding dilated
difference/sum sets reach `δ = 0` (equivalently `O(1/m)`), the BGK wall in pair-discrepancy form. -/
