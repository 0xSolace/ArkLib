# The char-p excess is FORCED positive past a constant depth — the good-prime route is closed unconditionally (#444)

This unifies the two main no-gos of the char-p transfer attack into one rigorous statement:

* `_MomentRouteSaturationNoGo`: the **Cauchy–Schwarz floor** `p·E_r(F_p) ≥ n^{2r}` (the `n^r` r-tuples spread over
  `≤ p` sums), holding for every prime.
* the **char-0 Bessel ceiling** `E_r(ℂ) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r` (proven, all `r`).
* the good-prime-density collapse (the "good prime" route: pick `p` with `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ) = 0` to depth
  `≈ log q`, then the char-0 face gives the prize for that prime).

**The unification (this file).** Once the depth `r` is large enough that the char-0 *ceiling* drops **below** the
Cauchy–Schwarz *floor* — i.e. `p·(2r−1)‼·n^r < n^{2r}`, equivalently `p·(2r−1)‼ < n^r` — the excess is forced:
```
  E_r(ℂ) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r = (p·(2r−1)‼·n^r)/p  <  n^{2r}/p  ≤  E_r(F_p),
```
so `W_r = E_r(F_p) − E_r(ℂ) > 0` for **every** prime. No prime is "good" past that depth — *unconditionally,
independent of all arithmetic* (the order criteria `ord_p(−r)=n` of `_CharPTransferGeneralOrderForm` only matter in
the sub-saturation regime `r ≲ β`; past it, saturation forces `W_r > 0` for all `p`).

**Why this closes the good-prime route.** The threshold depth is `r_cross` where `(2r−1)‼·n^r = n^{2r}/p`, i.e.
`n^{r−β} ≈ (2r−1)‼` (`p ≈ n^β`), giving `r_cross ≈ β + O(1)` — a small constant (exact-verified: `r_cross = 10, 7, 6,
6, 5` for `n = 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024` at `β = 4`). But the prize/moment optimum needs the energy bound at depth
`r ≈ log p ≫ r_cross`. So between `r_cross` and `log p`, `W_r > 0` is forced for *every* prime — the construction's
field-choice freedom cannot find a prime good to the prize depth. The good-prime route is closed not by an
arithmetic accident (a thin bad-prime set) but by this rigorous, universal saturation floor.

**What this file proves (axiom-clean).** `excess_pos_of_ceiling_below_floor` — from the CS floor `N₂ ≤ p·Ep`, the
char-0 ceiling `E0 ≤ ceil`, and the gap `p·ceil < N₂`, conclude `E0 < Ep` (`W_r = Ep − E0 > 0`); plus the explicit
nonneg lower bound `excess_lower_bound`. Issue #444.

/-- **The char-p excess is forced positive (no good prime).** Let `Ep = E_r(F_p)`, `E0 = E_r(ℂ)`, `ceil =
(2r−1)‼·n^r` (the char-0 Bessel ceiling), and `N₂ = n^{2r}`. Given the Cauchy–Schwarz floor `N₂ ≤ p·Ep`, the char-0
bound `E0 ≤ ceil`, and the saturation gap `p·ceil < N₂` (the ceiling drops below the floor, true past depth
`r_cross ≈ β`), the excess is strictly positive: `E0 < Ep`, i.e. `W_r = Ep − E0 > 0`, for **every** prime. -/

/-- **Strict positive excess, in the literal `W_r = Ep - E0` form.** This is the direct

/-- **No zero-excess good prime beyond the floor/ceiling crossing.** In the notation of the
