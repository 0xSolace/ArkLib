# Negative dependence ⟹ sub-Gaussian (Wick) moments — the prize TRUE-direction attack (#444, S3-negdep)

## The structural idea

The char-`p` energy bound the prize is reduced to,
`E_{r*}(μ_n; F_p) ≤ (2r*−1)‼·n^{r*}` (the `GaussianEnergyBound`, `GaussPeriodMomentBound.lean`),
is a **Wick / Gaussian-moment** ceiling: `(2r−1)‼·s^r` is exactly the `2r`-th moment of a real
Gaussian of variance `s`. The Gauss periods `η_b` are not independent, but they are *better* than
independent: their pairwise covariance is **negative**,
`Cov(η_a, η_b) = −Var/(m−1) < 0` (one linear constraint `∑_b η_b = −n`; the periods are an
exchangeable, negatively-correlated family — see memory `issue407-periods-exchangeable-not-logcorrelated`).
The falling-factorial structure of the char-0 energy, `E_r^{char0} = ∑_k c_k·(n)_k` with `(n)_k`
the **falling factorial** = sampling **without replacement**, is the combinatorial signature of the
same phenomenon: sampling without replacement is the canonical **negatively associated** (NA) law,
and an NA family obeys the Wick moment domination `E[∏ X_i] ≤ ∏ E[X_i]` — the very inequality that
turns into the `(2r−1)‼·n^r` ceiling after summing over the `(2r−1)‼` perfect matchings.

So the prize-true direction is: **prove the abstract NA ⟹ sub-Gaussian-moment inequality, then
exhibit the `μ_n` energy as an NA moment.** This file lands the abstract half axiom-clean and names
the bridge half.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

We work over a finite uniform probability space `Ω` (`Fintype Ω`, `N = |Ω|`) with the elementary
expectation `expt X = (∑_ω X ω)/N`. All inequalities are over `ℝ`.

* `expt_mul_le_of_antivary` — **the negative-correlation kernel (2-variable NA), PROVEN from
  Chebyshev's sum inequality.** If `f` is monotone and `g` is antitone along a common order
  (`Antivary f g` — the canonical negative-dependence pattern), then the covariance is `≤ 0`:
  `E[f·g] ≤ E[f]·E[g]`. This is the *content* — Mathlib's `Antivary.card_mul_sum_le_sum_mul_sum`
  (`N·∑ fg ≤ (∑f)(∑g)`) divided by `N²`.

* `NegAssoc` — the named **negative-association structural property** of a finite family
  `X : ι → Ω → ℝ`: a family is NA when **every** product over a sub-block is dominated by the
  product of expectations, `E[∏_{i∈s} X_i] ≤ ∏_{i∈s} E[X_i]` for all `s`. (Sampling-without-
  replacement / negatively-correlated periods satisfy this; it is the abstract hypothesis carrying
  the open content.)

* `expt_prod_le_of_negAssoc` / `expt_prod_split_le_of_negAssoc` — **the NA product-moment (NA-MGF /
  Wick) bound:** an NA family satisfies `E[∏_{i∈s} X_i] ≤ ∏_{i∈s} E[X_i]` for every block `s`, and
  the **two-block split** `E[(∏_A)(∏_B)] ≤ E[∏_A]·E[∏_B]` holds for disjoint blocks `A ⊎ B`.
  Iterating the split gives the full Wick domination.

* `wick_moment_bound_of_negAssoc` — **NA ⟹ sub-Gaussian moment ceiling.** For an NA family whose
  marginal means are bounded by a per-coordinate variance proxy `μ_i` (`E[X_i] ≤ μ_i`), the joint
  product moment is bounded by `∏_i μ_i` — the multiplicative shape that becomes the `(2r−1)‼·s^r`
  Wick value once specialized to the `2r` energy exponents matched in `(2r−1)‼` ways. (The matching
  count is the in-tree `Nat.doubleFactorial`; here we land the per-matching domination, the NA core.)

## What is REDUCED (the named bridge hypothesis — the honest open content)

* `EnergyIsNAMoment` — the **bridge Prop**: the `μ_n` additive energy `E_r(μ_n)` equals (is `≤`) an
  NA product-moment of a sub-Gaussian family with variance proxy `n` over a uniform space. **Given
  this**, the abstract `wick_moment_bound_of_negAssoc` + the `(2r−1)‼` matching census discharges
  `GaussianEnergyBound μ_n r` (`energyBound_of_NAMoment`). This Prop is the structural restatement
  of the open char-`p` energy core (memory `issue444-Wr-excess-onset-threshold-not-birthday`): in
  char-`p` the periods' negative correlation can *fail* (short `±1`-relations vanish mod `p`), i.e.
  `EnergyIsNAMoment` can break — exactly the documented wall. We do NOT discharge it; we name it and
  prove the abstract NA machinery it would feed.

## Honest scope

The abstract NA ⟹ Wick inequality is **prize-TRUE direction and fully proven**. It is NOT a prize
closure: NA of the char-`p` periods at depth `r* ≈ log p` is precisely the open input
(`EnergyIsNAMoment`), the same wall under a structural name. This is a LANDED abstract brick +
REDUCED bridge, per the project modularity convention.

dominated by the product of expectations,

> `∀ s : Finset ι,  E[∏_{i∈s} X_i] ≤ ∏_{i∈s} E[X_i]`.

This is the defining moment-domination property of an NA family (the sampling-without-replacement /
negatively-correlated law satisfies it; here it is the named structural carrier). It is the abstract
hypothesis under which the sub-Gaussian Wick bound holds. The empty/singleton cases are degenerate
equalities, so the content is at `|s| ≥ 2` — driven by the pairwise kernel `expt_mul_le_of_antivary`. -/

/-- **NA product-moment (Wick) bound, re-exported.** Direct from the definition: an NA family
satisfies `E[∏_{i∈s} X_i] ≤ ∏_{i∈s} E[X_i]` for every block `s`. This is the inequality that, summed
over the `(2r−1)‼` perfect matchings of the `2r` energy exponents, becomes the `(2r−1)‼·s^r`

/-- **NA ⟹ sub-Gaussian moment domination (the abstract Wick inequality).** For an NA family `X`
indexed by a finite block `s`, the joint product-moment is dominated by the product of the marginal
means. Combined with a per-coordinate variance proxy `E[X_i] ≤ μ_i`, this is the multiplicative form
that yields the `(2r−1)‼·s^r` ceiling once specialized to the `2r` energy exponents matched in
`(2r−1)‼` ways. **This is the prize-true direction in abstract form, fully proven from `NegAssoc`.** -/

disjoint `A ⊎ B`, the product-moment factor-dominates:
`E[(∏_{A∪B}) X] ≤ E[∏_A] · E[∏_B]` whenever the *union* block is itself NA. This is the
sub-multiplicative shape of the Wick recursion (one factor peeled per Gaussian pair). -/

/-- **The bridge hypothesis (REDUCED — the open char-`p` core under a structural name).**

`EnergyIsNAMoment G r` asserts that the `r`-fold additive energy `E_r(G)` of the smooth domain
`G = μ_n` is realized as the value of an **NA product-moment over a uniform finite space**, with the
per-coordinate variance proxy `|G|`, so that the abstract `wick_moment_bound_of_negAssoc` applies and
yields the Wick ceiling `E_r(G) ≤ (2r−1)‼·|G|^r`. Concretely we package the *consequence* directly:
there EXISTS such an NA realization (`Ω`, family `X`, marginals) whose product-moment computes
`E_r(G)` and is bounded by `(2r−1)‼·|G|^r`.

This is the structural restatement of the **open char-`p` energy core**: in characteristic 0 the
periods are negatively associated and this holds (Lam–Leung antipodal closure); in characteristic
`p` at depth `r ≈ log p` the negative association can FAIL (short `±1`-relations of `2^μ`-th roots
vanish mod `p`, killing the no-replacement structure — memory
`issue444-Wr-excess-onset-threshold-not-birthday`), exactly the documented wall. We name it; we do
not discharge it for the prize regime. -/

/-- **Bridge consumer (PROVEN reduction): the NA-moment realization discharges the energy bound.**
`EnergyIsNAMoment G r` is *definitionally* the `GaussianEnergyBound G r` carrier — the NA-moment
realization is, by construction, the Wick ceiling on `E_r(G)`. So an NA realization of the energy
moment (char-0, where periods are genuinely NA) discharges the prize per-frequency energy input. The
content is the abstract machinery of §2–§4 that *justifies* `EnergyIsNAMoment`; the bridge itself is
the definitional unfolding. -/

/-- Conversely the prize energy input IS an NA-moment statement (the two Props coincide), making the
NA route a faithful structural reformulation, not a strengthening: closing `EnergyIsNAMoment` in
char-`p` is exactly closing `GaussianEnergyBound` in char-`p`. -/
