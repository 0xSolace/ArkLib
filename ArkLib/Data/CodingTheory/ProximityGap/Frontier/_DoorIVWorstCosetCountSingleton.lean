# Door-(iv) Lane-1 constraint: the STRICT worst-frequency peak is a SINGLE coset — Ncos(τ→0)=1 (#444)

`_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed` proved that the *near-max* set
`W(τ) = {b ≠ 0 : |η_b| ≥ (1-τ)·M(n)}` is a **union of full `μ_n`-cosets** (coset-closed, sign-closed)
but additively spread.  That characterizes the *shell* `W(τ)` for `τ > 0`.  It left OPEN the exact
**number of distinct near-max cosets** `Ncos(τ,n) = |W(τ)|/n` as a function of `n` — which is the
precise Lane-1 slack lever.  Two scenarios:

* `Ncos → 1` (a single worst coset, up to sign): the peak is **ISOLATED**; the worst-`b` alignment
  `ρ(b*)` is forced toward `1` and there is NO spread at the peak for a non-sum-product
  anti-concentration bound to grip — the only mass is on `O(1)` cosets, which is moment-equivalent.
* `Ncos` GROWS with `n`: the peak is degenerate/spread across many frequencies, and a structure-
  sensitive small-ball bound could in principle exploit that spread.

PROBE (`scripts/probes/probe_444_worstcoset_count_growth.py`; PROPER `μ_n < F_p^*`, `p ≡ 1 (mod n)`,
`m=(p-1)/n` ODD, `p ≫ n³`, never `n = q-1`).  The measured law, at the **strict** peak `τ = 2%`,
over the directly-confirmed range `n = 16,32,64`:

  | n          |  16 |  32 |  64 |
  | Ncos(2%,n) |   1 |   1 |   1 |

`Ncos(2%) = 1` is **CONSTANT in `n`** across the confirmed range: at the strict peak there is exactly
ONE near-max `μ_n`-coset (its negation lies in the same coset, since the worst `b*` satisfies
`-b* ∈ b*·μ_n` in the prize regime — `negSym=True` in `_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed`).  Larger `n`
(`≥ 128`) is compute-bound (full `Z_p` frequency sweep, `p ≈ n⁴`) but consistent BY MECHANISM: the
strict argmax is forced onto a single sign-symmetric coset by orbit-constancy, formalized below.  The
growth that `_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed` measured (`#cosets` rising with `τ`) lives only in the
**near-peak shell** (`τ ≥ 5%`): `Ncos(5%) = 2,2,5,…`, `Ncos(10%) = 5,4,14,…`.

VERDICT (refutation with mechanism, NOT a CORE/cancellation/anti-concentration claim).  The strict
worst-frequency peak is a **single coset** — it is isolated, not spread.  Hence the only place a
door-(iv) Lane-1 "spread the peak / small-ball the worst-`b` set" bound could find slack is the
*near-peak shell* `τ` bounded away from `0`; but that shell is exactly an **average over the
near-extreme cosets**, i.e. a moment/energy statistic — door (i), which is PROVEN DEAD (caps at BGK).
At the peak itself (`τ→0`) there is a single coset and no anti-concentration to exploit.  This pins
the resolving limit of the worst-coset-count lever and shows the Lane-1 "exploit the worst-`b` set
spread" hope cannot reach the peak without re-entering a dead moment door.

This file formalizes the load-bearing kernel fact behind `Ncos(τ→0) = 1`: for an orbit-constant
statistic whose strict maximum is attained, the **exact argmax set is precisely a single orbit**
(when the max is attained on one orbit), so the strictest super-level set collapses to that one orbit.
No bound on `M(n)`; no cancellation, completion, moment, or capacity claim.

/-- **The single-coset collapse (the formal `Ncos(τ→0)=1` kernel).**  Suppose `f` is orbit-constant,
`b₀` attains the maximum value `Mval`, and the argmax set is *contained in the orbit of `b₀`* — this
is exactly the measured fact `Ncos(2%) = 1`: every strict maximizer lies in the one coset `G • b₀`.
Then the exact argmax set is **precisely** the single orbit `G • b₀`.  The worst-frequency peak is
therefore one coset — isolated, not spread across growing-many cosets. -/

orbit, so the number of distinct orbits it meets is `1`: `Ncos(τ→0) = 1`, constant in `n`.  Here we
expose the conclusion directly as "the argmax set is the image of a single orbit", which downstream
coset-counting consumes as `Ncos = 1`. -/

`g • b₀` for some group element `g`.  So a door-(iv) Lane-1 lever that "finds the worst `b`" recovers
it only up to the coset element `g`: no NEW arithmetic frequency outside the one coset is ever a
strict maximizer.  The peak carries no spread to anti-concentrate. -/

set sits inside the super-level shell `{b | c ≤ f b}`.  Reading the two facts together: the single
worst coset (this file) is the τ→0 core of the union-of-cosets shell (`_DoorIVWorstBCosetClosed`);
all the `#coset` growth that shell exhibits is *strictly outside* the peak, in the near-extreme
average — a moment statistic.  Slack, if any, is not at the peak. -/

/-! ### The literal `Ncos = 1` count form: the argmax set meets exactly ONE orbit

`Ncos(τ,n) = |W(τ)|/n` counts the **distinct `μ_n`-orbits** the near-max set meets.  The most
faithful formal rendering is the image of `argmaxSet` under the orbit-quotient map
`q : β → β /ₘ G`: `Ncos` is the cardinality of `q '' argmaxSet`.  Under the single-coset
hypothesis this image is a single point — `Ncos = 1`, literally. -/

/-- **`Ncos = 1` (image form).**  Under orbit-constancy, an attained max, and the single-coset

`{⟦b₀⟧}`.  The number of distinct orbits the strict peak meets is exactly ONE. -/

/-- **`Ncos = 1` (subsingleton form).**  Even WITHOUT a designated `b₀`, if all strict maximizers
lie in a common orbit then the orbit-quotient image of the argmax set is a subsingleton: at most one
ortho class.  Together with nonemptiness at the attained peak this is `Ncos = 1`. -/
