/-! # Disjoint radius-`r` balls below half the distance (unique-decoding geometry)

The geometric fact underpinning the lower-window half of the δ* closed form
(`DISPROOF_LOG` O173/O182): below the unique-decoding radius — when `2r < d` for `d` the
Hamming distance between two codewords — their radius-`r` Hamming balls are disjoint, so no
received word is `r`-close to both. Consequently the second-moment cross term
`Σ_d A_d · I_∩(d)` over codeword pairs is empty for `δ < (1−ρ)/2` (where `2⌊δn⌋ < d_min`), so
`worst = average` and the closed form `δ* = H_q⁻¹(1−ρ−log_q(1/ε*)/n)` holds *unconditionally*
in the lower window.

Self-contained: a triangle-inequality argument. No MDS machinery is needed — the distance is
taken as a hypothesis, which any code satisfies for distinct codewords with `d := d_min`. -/
