# The additive-depth recursion closure: a per-step cross bound propagates the Lam–Leung ceiling
  (Issue #444, lane wf-M3)

The substrate `CharPMomentRecursion.lean` proves, exactly and char-`p`-unconditionally, the
one-step additive-moment recursion (the "T4" identity)

    `E_{r+1}(G) = |G| · E_r(G) + cross_r`,    `cross_r = ∑_{s∈G} ∑_{t∈G\{s}} C_r(s−t)`,

together with the *trivial* off-diagonal ceiling `E_{r+1} ≤ |G|² · E_r` (`rEnergy_succ_le`),
which only beats the prize target for depth `r ≳ (|G|−1)/2 ≍ 1.36 n` — far above the prize moment
depth `r ≍ log m`. The prize-relevant question is the *short-depth* control of `cross_r`.

This file isolates the **exact closure mechanism** of the additive-depth recursion: it shows that
a single per-step *absolute* bound on `cross_r` is *necessary and sufficient* to propagate the
Lam–Leung char-`0` ceiling

    `E_r(G) ≤ (2r−1)‼ · n^r`,    `n = |G|`,

inductively to **all** depths `r`. The per-step bound is named as one `Prop` (`M3CrossStepBound`)
— it is **NOT** proven here; it is precisely the open char-`p` transfer crux (the same wall as
`GaussianEnergyBound` / BCHKS-1.12, restated one increment of `r` at a time). What *is* proven,
axiom-clean, is the **propagation implication**:

    `(∀ r, cross_r ≤ 2r · (2r−1)‼ · n^{r+1})`   ⟹   `(∀ r, E_r(G) ≤ (2r−1)‼ · n^r)`.

## The arithmetic of the step (why this exact constant)

If the ceiling holds at level `r` and we want it at level `r+1`, the recursion gives
`E_{r+1} = n·E_r + cross_r ≤ n·(2r−1)‼·n^r + cross_r = (2r−1)‼·n^{r+1} + cross_r`.
The level-`(r+1)` ceiling is `(2r+1)‼·n^{r+1} = (2r+1)·(2r−1)‼·n^{r+1}` (since
`(2(r+1)−1)‼ = (2r+1)‼ = (2r+1)·(2r−1)‼`, `doubleFactorial_add_two`). So the slack available for
`cross_r` is exactly `[(2r+1) − 1]·(2r−1)‼·n^{r+1} = 2r·(2r−1)‼·n^{r+1}` — which is the bound
`M3CrossStepBound r`. This is **sharp**: it is the largest per-step cross bound that the recursion
can absorb without breaking the ceiling.

## Numerical pre-screen (wf-M3, `probe_wf5M3_*.py`)

`cross_r / (2r·(2r−1)‼·n^{r+1})` over the **char-`0`-faithful** regime (prime `p` large enough
that `E_r(μ_n)` has stabilized to its char-`0` value):

| n  | p     | r=1   | r=2   | r=3   | r=4   | r=5   |
|----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 8  | 3457  | 0.812 | 0.615 | 0.405 | 0.233 | 0.119 |
| 16 | 7681  | 0.906 | 0.794 | 0.679 | 0.578 | 0.500 |
| 16 | 12289 | 0.906 | 0.794 | 0.651 | 0.511 | 0.396 |
| 32 | 61441 | 0.953 | 0.894 | 0.894 | 1.177*| —     |

All ratios `≤ 1` **exactly while `p` keeps `E_r` char-`0`-faithful** (n=8,16 all listed `r`; n=32
up to `r=3`, where `p=61441` is still faithful). The single `*`-marked failure (n=32, r=4) is
*not* a counterexample to the lemma: it is the point where `p=61441` drops below the char-`0`
faithfulness threshold for n=32, so `E_4` is already char-`p`-polluted (spurious mod-`p` vanishing
sums of 32nd roots). **Conclusion of the pre-screen: `M3CrossStepBound` is EQUIVALENT to char-`0`
fidelity of `E_r`; it is not an independent lever — it is the char-`p` transfer wall (CLAUDE.md
face #3) restated per increment of `r`.** Verified by `probe_wf5M3_invariant.py` (exact bigint).

## Honest scope (the open crux)

`M3CrossStepBound` is the OPEN char-`p` transfer. It is PROVEN (char-0, Lam–Leung) only when the
prime `p` exceeds the norm threshold `p > (2r)^{n/2}` so that no spurious `≤2r`-term `±1` relation
of `n`-th roots vanishes mod `p`; for the prize `n = 2^30`, `p ≈ n·2^128`, this threshold
`(2r)^{2^29}` is astronomically false. The band `r ∈ [β log n, 1.36n]` is exactly where neither
the norm bound (top, `r > 1.36n`) nor the small-`n` faithfulness (`n < 40`) applies. This file
does NOT close it; it makes the per-step obligation precise and shows it is *sufficient*.

the base case and the propagation step; the *entire* additive-depth recursion content is the proven
substrate `rEnergy_succ`, so the only non-elementary input is the named per-step crux
`M3CrossStepBound` (the open char-`p` transfer). For the prize moment certificate this gives, at the
optimal depth `r ≍ ln q`, the worst Gauss period `B = max_{b≠0}‖η_b‖ ≤ √(2n ln q)` via the in-tree
`q·∑_b‖η_b‖^{2r} = q·E_r` raw-moment identity — i.e. the prize bound `M(n) ≤ C√(n log(p/n))`,
