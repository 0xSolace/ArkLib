# The `r = 2` rung of the open energy ladder is UNCONDITIONAL for `μ_n` — and THINNESS-ESSENTIAL (#444)

The prize per-frequency bound is carried (via the in-tree `GaussPeriodMomentBound` consumer chain)
by the single named family `GaussianEnergyBound G r : E_r(G) ≤ (2r−1)‼·|G|^r` at depth `r ≈ ln q`.
The energy-ladder reduction (`Frontier/_EnergyRatioMonotoneReduction.lean`,
`gaussianEnergyBound_of_ERM`) steps the bound up one order at a time from a base rung, and its
module doc asserts in prose that the low rungs hold — *"the base case `r = 1` is still PROVEN
(`E_2 = 3n²−3n ≤ 3n·n`), and `r = 2` holds (slack `1−1/n`)"* — but it never lands
`GaussianEnergyBound (μ_n) 2` as a theorem from the in-tree exact closed form, nor records that this
low rung is **thinness-essential** (it is FALSE for thick / high-additive-energy domains).

This file discharges that prose. Two bricks:

* **`gaussianEnergyBound_muN_two`** (HEADLINE) — `GaussianEnergyBound (μ_n) 2`, i.e.
  `E_2(μ_n) ≤ 3·|μ_n|²`, UNCONDITIONALLY for the thin 2-power subgroup `μ_n ⊂ F_p`
  (`n = 2^m`, `m ≥ 1`, `p > 2^n`). Derived from the in-tree exact value
  `REnergyTwoExact.mu_n_rEnergy_two_eq` (`E_2 = 3n²−3n`) and `mu_n_card_eq` (`|μ_n| = n`):
  the bound is `3n²−3n ≤ 3·n²` ⟺ `0 ≤ 3n`. The `(2·2−1)‼ = 3‼ = 3` coefficient matches exactly,
  with slack `3n` (the `1−1/n` relative slack the ladder doc names). This is the first non-trivial
  verified order of the `GaussianEnergyBound` ladder (`r = 1` is the trivial Parseval base
  `E_1 = |G|`), the concrete rung that `gaussianEnergyBound_of_ERM` consumes off the base.

* **`gaussianEnergyBound_two_thinness_essential`** (the rule-3 CONSTRAINT LEMMA) — the same
  `r = 2` bound `E_2 ≤ 3|G|²` is **NOT a general / thickness-monotone fact**: for a domain `G` whose
  depth-2 additive energy exceeds `3|G|²` it FAILS. We record the contrapositive as a clean Lean
  statement (`3·|G|² < E_2(G) → ¬ GaussianEnergyBound G 2`), making explicit that the `μ_n` rung
  above is a thinness-essential lever, NOT a free monotone inequality. Probe
  `scripts/probes/probe_erm_r1_sharp.py` exhibits the failure concretely: random negation-closed
  sets in `ℤ_p` fail it (4/12), and arithmetic progressions fail it badly (`E_2 ≈ 489` vs `3|G|² =
  243` at `|G| = 9`), while `μ_n` satisfies it with exact slack `3n` at every `n` tested
  (`n = 4,…,64`). So the bound is true on the thin subgroup precisely *because* `μ_n` is
  Sidon-mod-negation at depth 2 (its only depth-2 additive relations are the trivial
  `z + (−z) = 0`), and false off it. This is the brief's rule-3 thinness-essentiality made into a
  theorem at the `r = 2` rung.

## Honest scope (rules 1, 3, 6)

This is a single-rung discharge, NOT a CORE closure. The prize CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))`
lives at the DEEP order `r ≈ ln q` (the full DC-Wick ladder, the BGK / Paley √-cancellation wall),
which `gaussianEnergyBound_of_ERM` cannot reach because the global energy-ratio step `ERM` is REFUTED
past `r ≈ n/4` (`Frontier/_EnergyRatioMonotoneReduction.lean`). This file does **not** touch that
wall. It lands the `r = 2` rung as an honest theorem (replacing the ladder doc's prose claim by a
proof from the in-tree exact closed form), and records — via the constraint lemma — that the rung is
thinness-essential, hence a valid rule-3 lever rather than a thickness-monotone one. No moment /
census / orbit re-derivation, no capacity / beyond-Johnson / growth-law claim, cliff-at-`n/2`
untouched. EXTEND-proven on `REnergyTwoExact.mu_n_rEnergy_two_eq` + `GaussianEnergyBound`.

/-- **CONSTRAINT LEMMA (rule 3): the `r = 2` Gaussian rung is THINNESS-ESSENTIAL.**
For ANY finite domain `G` over a field whose depth-2 additive energy strictly exceeds `3·|G|²`,
the `r = 2` Gaussian energy bound FAILS. Contrapositive of unfolding `GaussianEnergyBound G 2`
(`E_2(G) ≤ 3·|G|²`). Together with `gaussianEnergyBound_muN_two` this pins that the `μ_n` rung is a
genuine thin-subgroup lever and NOT a thickness-monotone inequality: probe
`probe_erm_r1_sharp.py` exhibits explicit `G` (random negation-closed sets, and especially
arithmetic progressions, e.g. `E_2 = 489 > 243 = 3·|G|²` at `|G| = 9`) where the hypothesis holds, so
the conclusion `¬ GaussianEnergyBound G 2` applies — the bound is FALSE off the thin regime. -/
