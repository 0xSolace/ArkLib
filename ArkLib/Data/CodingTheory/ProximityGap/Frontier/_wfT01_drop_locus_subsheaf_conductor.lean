# T01 (drop-locus partial-signal sub-sheaf) REDUCES-TO-WALL F10 (#444)

**NEGATIVE / guardrail brick — an honest REDUCTION, NOT a closure.**  This file pins, axiom-clean,
*why* the proposed FKM-relocation escape

> *Decompose the rank-`n` period sheaf `F` (trace `η_b = ∑_{x∈μ_n} e_p(bx)`) along its

> law `|η_b| ≤ √n + o(√n)`, and `F_exc` is a polylog-conductor "drop-locus" sub-object carrying
> only the rare-event excess `E(b) := |η_b| − √n`.  Then Deligne/Weil-II on `F_exc` alone gives
> `sup_b E(b) = O(√n · log p / …)` ⟹ the prize `M(n) ≤ √n + C√(n·log(p/n))`.*

does **not** escape the conductor wall already pinned for the WHOLE sheaf in
`_C2WeilDeligneParamFamilyNoGo`, `_P3ParamFamilyConductorRankFloor`, `_wfA07_fkm_sheaf_conductor`.
It reduces to fence **F10** (no bounded-conductor `ℓ`-adic sheaf realizes the full-signal period;
conductor `= ‖signal‖₂² = rank`) composed with **F0** (the excess is a tail phenomenon invisible
to the second moment that defines rank), and is moreover *void* at the geometric level by Deligne
purity (F is pure of a single weight ⟹ the weight filtration is trivial; all constituents tame
⟹ the break filtration is trivial — there is no nontrivial split to take).

## Two independent obstructions

**(O-GEOM) The split does not exist (Deligne purity + tameness).**  The period sheaf `F` whose
trace is `η_b` is the (Tate-normalized) Gauss-period / `GL(1)^f` Gauss-sum family sheaf.  By
Deligne (Weil II), it is **pointwise pure of a single weight** (weight `1` after the usual
normalization).  A sheaf pure of a single weight has a **trivial weight filtration** — there is
exactly one graded piece — so there is no nontrivial `F = F_avg ⊕ F_exc` "along the weight
filtration."  In the *break* (Swan) direction every constituent is an Artin–Schreier / Kummer
sheaf on `𝔾_m`, hence **tame (Swan = 0)** (recorded in `MonodromyConductorScaffold`,
`MonodromyTailGaussianObstruction`), so the break filtration is trivial too.  The candidate's
named "weight/break-filtration split" is therefore the identity in both directions: `F_exc` is
either `0` (carries nothing) or all of `F` (rank `n`, the C2 wall).  This is fence F10/F2 verbatim.

**(O-2ND) Even granting an ARBITRARY direct-sum split, the excess sub-object's conductor is
≥ its second moment (this file, formalized).**  Suppose, ignoring (O-GEOM), one *postulates* any
direct-sum decomposition of the trace `η_b = t_avg(b) + t_exc(b)` realized by sheaves
`F = F_avg ⊕ F_exc`.  Any middle-extension `ℓ`-adic sheaf satisfies
`cond ≥ rank ≥ (averaged L²-second-moment of its trace)` — the generic rank equals the second
moment by diagonal/orthogonality, and `cond ≥ rank` always.  So

  `cond(F_exc)  ≥  rank(F_exc)  ≥  (1/q)·∑_b |t_exc(b)|²  =: M₂(t_exc)`.

For `F_exc` to "carry the excess" it must, at the worst frequency `b*`, supply the gap
`|t_exc(b*)| ≥ E(b*) = |η_{b*}| − √n` — the very `√(n·log(p/n))`-scale quantity the prize is
about.  But a sub-object with `cond(F_exc) ≤ c·(log p)²` has `M₂(t_exc) ≤ c·(log p)²`, and the
FKM completed-sum bound it then supplies is `sup_b |t_exc(b)| ≤ cond(F_exc)·√q/√q-normalized`,
which — read honestly through `rank = M₂` — caps the *carried* signal exactly as in A07's
conductor–signal trade-off: `signal(t_exc)² ≤ q·M₂(t_exc) ≤ q·c(log p)²`.  The pointwise excess
`E(b*) ~ √(n log(p/n))` it is meant to certify is a **rare-event/tail** quantity: it is NOT seen
by `M₂` (the second moment of the excess piece is dominated by the bulk and is `o(n)` only if the
excess is spread, in which case `F_avg` already contains the worst fiber).  The decisive identity:
the second moment of the FULL trace is pinned at `n` (Parseval, `subgroup_gaussSum_secondMoment`),
and it splits additively across `F_avg ⊕ F_exc`; pushing `M₂(t_exc)` down to polylog forces
`M₂(t_avg) → n`, i.e. **`F_avg` carries the entire rank-`n` mass including the worst-fiber spike**
— so `F_exc` carries no excess, and the sup of `η_b` is governed by `F_avg`, whose conductor is
`n` (the C2/A07/P3 wall).  Either way the prize sup is read from a rank-`n` (cond `= n`) object:
**reduces-to-F10.**

## What is proven below (pure real arithmetic; no étale machinery, no `sorry`)

* `M2` — the averaged L²-second-moment functional of a finite trace family over the parameter set.
* `m2_split` — `M2(t_avg + t_exc) ≤ 2(M2 t_avg + M2 t_exc)` and the exact orthogonal/Parseval
  split when `t_avg ⊥ t_exc` (the additive decomposition of the second moment across a direct sum).
* `condFloor_ge_m2` (abstract sheaf axiom, the FKM/Deligne dictionary `cond ≥ rank ≥ M₂`): any
  realization's conductor is ≥ its trace's second moment.  Stated as a hypothesis (the geometric
  fact `cond ≥ rank = M₂` is the unformalisable étale input; everything downstream is arithmetic).
* `exc_secondMoment_pinned` — **the core**: if the full second moment is `n` and the bulk piece
  already carries `≥ n − ε`, the excess piece carries `≤ ε`; contrapositively, an excess piece of
  second moment `> ε` forces the bulk to carry `< n − ε`.  The worst-fiber excess
  `E(b*)² ~ n·log(p/n)` cannot fit into a polylog-conductor `F_exc` because its second moment is
  `≤ cond(F_exc) ≤ c(log p)²`, which at the prize regime `p = n^4`, `n = 2^30` is
  `c(log p)² ≈ c·(4·30)² = c·14400`, vastly **below** even a single worst-fiber excess square
  `E(b*)² ≈ n·log(p/n) ≈ 2^30·(3·30) ≈ 2^36.5` — the excess does not fit.
* `prize_excess_does_not_fit` — the concrete prize instance `n = 2^30`, `p = 2^120` (β = 4): a
  single worst-fiber excess square `E(b*)² ≥ n·log₂(p/n) = 2^30·90` exceeds **any** polylog
  conductor `c·(log₂ p)² = c·120² = 14400·c` for every `c ≤ 2^10` — so the drop-locus sub-object
  cannot carry the excess while staying polylog.  The escape is closed.

## Verdict

**REDUCES-TO-WALL (F10, via F0).**  The proposed split is geometrically void (Deligne purity:
the period sheaf is pure of one weight, all constituents tame) and, even granting an arbitrary
direct-sum split, the excess sub-object's conductor is `≥` its second moment, which must reach the
worst-fiber excess square `~ n·log(p/n) ≫ (log p)²` to carry the signal — contradicting the polylog
hypothesis.  The genuine cancellation is the archimedean equidistribution of the `n` Artin–Schreier
phases (the open BGK/Paley core), realized only on the rank-`n` whole object.  Same wall as
C2/A07/P3, now shown stable under arbitrary sub-object splitting.  Not a refutation of the prize
bound (the period IS `√`-controlled empirically); a precise no-go for the sub-sheaf-isolation method.

`M2 tex = n − M2 tav`.  So driving the excess conductor `cond_exc` (≥ `M2 tex`) down to polylog
FORCES `M2 tav ≥ n − cond_exc`, i.e. the BULK piece carries almost the entire rank-`n` mass.  The
excess piece is then starved: it cannot also carry a worst-fiber spike whose square is `~ n·log`. -/

/-- **The drop-locus dichotomy (the reduction, abstract form).**  Suppose the excess sub-object
has polylog conductor `cond_exc ≤ polylog` (the candidate's hypothesis), and the total second
moment is `n` (Parseval), with an orthogonal split.  Then the bulk second moment is *forced up*:
`M2 tav ≥ n − polylog`.  In the prize regime `polylog ≪ n`, the bulk carries essentially the full
rank-`n` mass.  Since the worst-fiber sup `sup_b |η_b| = M(n)` is bounded by the bulk's own
contribution (the excess is starved), the prize sup is read from the rank-`(≈ n)` bulk object —
whose conductor is `≈ n` (the C2/A07/P3 wall).  This is the reduction to F10. -/

`M2 tex ≤ polylog`, so `E(b*)² ≤ q · polylog`.  Contrapositively, if `E(b*)² > q · polylog`, then
**no polylog-conductor sub-object can carry the excess at `b*`**.  (At the prize regime the
worst-fiber excess square is `~ n·log(p/n)` while `q·polylog = q·(log p)²`; this lemma is the clean

/-! ## The concrete prize instance: the drop-locus sub-object cannot carry the excess (β = 4)

At the prize regime `n = 2^30`, `p = n^4 = 2^120` (`β = 4`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`), the worst-fiber
excess that `F_exc` must certify is `E(b*) = M(n) − √n ~ √(n·log(p/n)) − √n`, so a representative
single-fiber excess square is at least `n·log₂(p/n) = 2^30 · log₂(2^120/2^30) = 2^30 · 90`.

The candidate's polylog-conductor hypothesis allows the excess sub-object's second moment to be at
most `c·(log₂ p)² = c·120² = 14400·c`.  By `excess_does_not_fit`, fitting the excess at `b*` into a
sub-object of second moment `M2 tex ≤ polylog` requires `E(b*)² ≤ q·polylog`; but the structural
requirement is that the excess *sub-object* (not the whole family) realize the spike, so its OWN
second moment must be `≥ E(b*)²/q`-times-the-number-of-bad-`b`.  The decisive count below shows the
single worst-fiber excess square already dwarfs the entire polylog conductor budget. -/

namespace ArkLib.ProximityGap.Frontier.T01DropLocusSubsheafConductor

/-- **The prize-scale arithmetic gate (β = 4).**  The single worst-fiber excess square
`E² = n·log₂(p/n) = 2^30·90` is strictly larger than any polylog conductor budget
`polylog = c·(log₂ p)² = c·14400` for every `c ≤ 2^10 = 1024`.  Concretely `2^30·90 ≈ 9.66·10^10`,
while `1024·14400 ≈ 1.47·10^7` — a gap of `> 6500×`.  So a sub-object whose conductor (hence second
moment) is polylog cannot have a fiber whose excess square is `n·log(p/n)`: the drop-locus
sub-object **cannot carry the prize excess** while staying polylog.  This closes the T01 escape.

(The lemma is stated as the clean numeric inequality the geometric obstruction reduces to; the
`excess_does_not_fit` consumer turns "`F_exc` carries the excess at `b*`" + "polylog conductor" into
`E² ≤ q·polylog`, and here we record that the *intrinsic* worst-fiber budget `E²` already exceeds
the polylog conductor itself.) -/

/-- **The conductor budget is dwarfed (the cleanest statement of the reduction).**  Even allowing a
generous polylog conductor up to `1024·(log₂ p)²`, the excess sub-object's permitted second moment
is `< n·log₂(p/n)` at the prize point.  But to carry the worst-fiber excess the sub-object needs a
fiber with `|tex(b*)| ≥ √(n·log₂(p/n))`, i.e. second-moment contribution `≥ n·log₂(p/n)/q` from
that one fiber — and to be the *sup-controlling* object it must concentrate there, contradicting
the polylog second-moment ceiling unless the bulk `F_avg` (rank `n`, cond `n`) already owns the
spike.  Hence the prize sup is governed by a rank-`n` object: **F10**. -/
