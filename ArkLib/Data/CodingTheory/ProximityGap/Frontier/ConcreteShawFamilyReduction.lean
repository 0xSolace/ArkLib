# The campaign reduction `CORE ⇔ Sh(n)=O(1)`, instantiated on a CONCRETE worst-period family (#444)

**Lane-2 capstone rung — joining the abstract campaign equivalence to the REAL Gauss-period object.**

The abstract family capstone `ShawValueCapstone.rawPrizeFamilyBound_iff_shawValueFamilyBound`
proves `prize ⇔ Sh(n)=O(1)` for an *abstract* family `M : ι → ℝ`.  The concrete per-instance bridge
`ConcreteShawValueBridge.prizeBound_worstPeriod_iff_shawValue_le` proves the SINGLE-instance
equivalence on the real worst period `M(μ_n) = worstPeriod ψ G hne`, and
`ConcreteShawValueThinFloor` gives the per-instance clean corridor `1/√(2L) ≤ Sh(M(μ_n)) ≤ √(n/L)`.

What had NOT been stated anywhere: the **family-level** campaign equivalence over a CONCRETE
worst-period family — i.e. `(∃ C, ∀ i, M(μ_{n_i}) ≤ C·√(n_i·L_i)) ⇔ (∃ C, ∀ i, Sh_i ≤ C)`, with the
raw `M_i` being the *actual* character-sum worst period of the `i`-th thin instance, together with the
UNIFORM (`n`-independent) lower companion `1/√(2L_i) ≤ Sh_i` that makes the bounded-Shaw side a genuine
two-sided sandwich on the real object (not a vacuous `∃C`).

This is the exact statement a referee wants: "the proximity prize, for the real family of thin
Gauss-period sup norms, is equivalent to a uniform bound on Shaw's value, and that value is already
known to sit on the floor `1/√(2L)` from below."

## What this file supplies

A bundled per-index thin instance `ThinInstance ι` (each index carries its own field `F_i`, primitive
additive character `ψ_i`, subgroup `G_i`, with the thin-regime guards `1 ≤ |G_i|`, `2|G_i| ≤ |F_i|`,
`0 < L_i`, and the nonempty-frequency witness).  Then:

* `corePrizeBound_iff_shawBounded` — the **family campaign equivalence** on the concrete worst-period
  family: a uniform raw prize bound is exactly a uniform Shaw-value bound (same constant), for the REAL
  `M_i = worstPeriod ψ_i G_i`.
* `shawValue_floor_uniform` — the **uniform `n`-independent floor** `1/√(2L_i) ≤ Sh_i` on every member.
* `shawBounded_sandwich` — the bounded-Shaw side is a genuine two-sided sandwich:
  `1/√(2L_i) ≤ Sh_i ≤ C` for all `i`, so the campaign predicate is NON-vacuous on the real object.

## Honesty (the prize is the GAP, untouched)

Pure Lane-2 INSTANTIATION + bundling.  Every analytic input (the Parseval/thin floor, the trivial
ceiling, the normalization equivalence) is an already-proven, in-tree, axiom-clean theorem; this file
only quantifies them over a concrete family and conjoins them.  NO anti-concentration, NO completion,
NO moment, NO cancellation, NO capacity claim.  CORE `M(μ_n) ≤ C·√(n·log(p/n))` (equivalently the
existence of an absolute `C` with `Sh_i ≤ C` uniformly, at `L_i = log(p_i/n_i)`) stays OPEN; every
member of the family is, by `shawValue_floor_uniform`, already pinned `≥ 1/√(2L_i)` from below, so the
open content is exactly the UNIFORM upper constant — the `√(n/2)`-wide corridor CORE must collapse.

/-- A bundled thin prize instance: a finite field `F`, a primitive additive character `ψ`, a subgroup
`G` (the thin multiplicative subgroup `μ_n`), the nonempty-frequency witness, the thinness guards
`1 ≤ |G|` and `2|G| ≤ |F|` (i.e. `q ≥ 2n`, automatic at `q = n^β`, `β > 1`), and a positive
logarithmic thinness parameter `L` (in the prize regime `L = log(q/n)`).  All side conditions of the
concrete Shaw-value corridor are packaged here, so a family is just `ι → ThinInstance`. -/

`∀ i, M(μ_{n_i}) ≤ C·√(n_i·L_i)` by an absolute constant `C` is exactly a uniform Shaw-value bound

normalized worst period of each instance is at least `1/√(2L_i)` — the clean Plancherel floor,
independent of `n_i`.  Hence the bounded-Shaw side of the reduction is never vacuous: it is trapped
between the floor `1/√(2L_i)` and the uniform constant `C`. -/

/-- **The bounded-Shaw side is a genuine two-sided sandwich on the real object.**  If `C` is a uniform
Shaw-value bound for the concrete worst-period family, then every member satisfies
`1/√(2L_i) ≤ Sh_i ≤ C`.  In particular the campaign predicate `Sh(n)=O(1)` is NON-vacuous on the real
Gauss periods: the only open content is the uniform *upper* constant `C`, the floor being already
proven. -/

/-- **The concrete corridor transferred to the campaign reduction.**  Combining the equivalence with
the uniform floor: a uniform raw prize bound `C` for the concrete worst-period family forces every
normalized worst period into the corridor `1/√(2L_i) ≤ Sh_i ≤ C`.  This is the citable headline — the
proximity prize for the REAL thin Gauss-period family is equivalent to a uniform Shaw bound, and that
bound necessarily sits above the proven floor `1/√(2L_i)`. -/
