# wf-T05 — Veronese moment-curve primitive-cohomology sub-bound: REDUCES-TO-WALL (F2) (#444)

## The candidate (Theorem-Architect G1-5)

T05 proposes to relocate the prize to the `(r+1)`-dimensional Veronese moment-curve family
`v_r(b) = (b, b², …, b^r)` acting on `r`-fold tensor dilates of `μ_n`, and to split the
cohomology of the configuration variety `V_r = {∑ ε_i x_i = 0}` into

* the **Wick (perfectly-matched-pairing) classes** that produce the `(2r−1)‼·n^r` main term, and
* the **PRIMITIVE part** `H*_prim`, of claimed dimension `dim_prim := C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼`,

and to claim that a "moment-curve (Veronese) transversality" assigns each primitive class an
EXTRA `p^{−1/2}` (weight `2(r−1)−1` instead of `2(r−1)`), giving the energy EXCESS over Wick

  `W_r := E_r(μ_n) − (2r−1)‼·n^r  ≤  dim_prim · p^{r−1} · p^{−(r−1)}  =  dim_prim = O_r(1)`,

hence (via the in-tree axiom-clean transfer `prize_of_charzero_limit` / `prize_of_transfer_slack`)
`M(n) ≤ C√(n·log(p/n))`.

The architect's own honesty note states the load-bearing claim precisely: *"if the primitive
classes on `V_r` are NOT transversalized by the Veronese (i.e. they remain pure of weight
`2(r−1)`), the Weil error stays `p^{r−1}` and the candidate reduces EXACTLY to F2/A04 and dies."*

## Verdict: REDUCES-TO-WALL (F2), and the central dimension formula is MALFORMED.

This file records, axiom-clean, **two independent structural failures** that collapse T05 onto
the configuration-variety Weil wall F2 (`_wfA04_weil_envelope_vacuity`,
`_wfS6_toric_config_betti`):

### (I) The `dim_prim` formula is incoherent at prize depth `r ≈ ln q`.

`dim_prim := C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼` presumes the `(2r−1)‼` Wick matchings are a SUB-count of the
`C(2r,r)` toric Betti classes (a "Catalan deficit"). They are NOT: they are incomparable counts
(the `(2r−1)‼` is the char-0 Lam–Leung vanishing-pairing count; `C(2r,r) ≤ 4^r` is the
Adolphson–Sperber toric Newton-polytope envelope, F2/S6). We prove

  `theorem wick_gt_betti : 4 ≤ r → C(2r,r) < (2r−1)‼`,

i.e. there are STRICTLY MORE Wick matchings than total Betti classes for every `r ≥ 4`. The prize
needs depth `r ≈ ln q ≈ 83 ≫ 4`. So over `ℕ` the proposed "primitive dimension"
`C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼` truncates to `0` (`dimPrimNat_eq_zero`), making the T05 bound read
`W_r ≤ 0` — which is FALSE for any prime at which the char-`p` energy exceeds char-0
(`spur_r > 0`). The "primitive deficit" cohomology that T05 wants to bound the excess is empty
at the relevant depths. **The ratio `(2r−1)‼ / C(2r,r) = r!/2^r → ∞`** (`wick_over_betti_ratio`),
so the gap is not a small-`r` artifact; it diverges super-exponentially at prize depth.

### (II) The Veronese moment curve folds up over `μ_n` — no transversality gain exists.

The transversality gain T05 needs requires the Veronese `v_r(b) = (b, …, b^r)` to put the
primitive classes in general position (open `r` independent directions). But over the
multiplicative subgroup `μ_n`, the power map `x ↦ x^j` sends `μ_n` INTO `μ_{n/gcd(j,n)} ⊆ μ_n`:
the moment curve closes up, **zero net curvature** (the in-tree `_VinogradovDecouplingVacuous`
Reason 2; `probe_wfT05_veronese_primitive_excess.rs` confirms `|image(x^j)| = n/gcd(j,n)`). We
encode this as `power_map_image_card_dvd`: the image cardinality `n/gcd(j,n)` divides `n` and is
`< n` whenever `gcd(j,n) > 1` (e.g. all even `j`). A curve that folds into the same `n`-point set
supplies no transversality, hence no per-class `p^{−1/2}` weight drop. The primitive classes
remain pure of weight `2(r−1)`, the Weil error stays `p^{r−1}`, and by the architect's own
dichotomy T05 reduces to F2/A04.

### (III) The measured excess is `Θ(n^{r−1})`, not `O_r(1)` (probe), confirming the reduction.

`probe_wfT05_veronese_primitive_excess.rs` (EXACT `r`-fold additive convolution over `ℤ_p`,
`β = 4`, `p = n^4`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`, `μ_n = ⟨2^μ⟩`): at the prize prime the excess is in fact
NEGATIVE (`E_r < (2r−1)‼·n^r`, matching S6 `spur ≡ 0`), and its MAGNITUDE scales as
`|W_r| / n^{r−1} → const` (`-3, -44, -560` for `r = 2,3,4`) — i.e. `Θ(n^{r−1})`, polynomial in
`n`, NOT the `n`-free `dim_prim = O_r(1)` T05 predicts. So even the SIGN and SCALING of the
quantity T05 bounds contradict the claimed `O_r(1)`.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean `ℕ`-arithmetic; `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

The structural facts (I) and (II) that make the T05 mechanism untenable at prize regime, plus the
explicit reduction to the in-tree F2 wall: if (counterfactually) the moment-curve transversality
gave the full weight drop, the prize would follow — but the fold fact and the malformed dimension
show it does not, pinning the residual back onto the open BGK/Paley char-`p` transfer wall.

This is an OBSTRUCTION/REDUCTION brick, NOT a closure.

`C(2r,r) < (2r−1)‼`. Hence the proposed `dim_prim = C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼` is "negative" — there are
MORE Wick matchings than total config-variety Betti classes. The two counts are incomparable;
`dim_prim` is not a cohomology dimension. The prize requires `r ≈ ln q ≈ 83 ≫ 4`, so the
formula is malformed throughout the relevant depth range. -/

truncated subtraction `C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼ = 0` in `ℕ`. So the T05 bound `W_r ≤ dim_prim` reads
`W_r ≤ 0` at every prize-relevant depth. This is the formal statement that the "primitive

the multiplicative gap directly: for `r ≥ 4`, `(2r−1)‼ · 2^r = C(2r,r) · r!` with `r! / 2^r → ∞`,
so the proposed `dim_prim` deficit is not merely negative but grows in magnitude with `r`. (Stated

/-- **The fold fact (cardinality of the power-map image).** Abstractly: the Veronese coordinate
`x ↦ x^j` on the cyclic group `μ_n` (order `n`) has image of size `n / gcd(j,n)`, which DIVIDES
`n`. So each Veronese coordinate folds `μ_n` into a (possibly proper) subgroup; the moment curve
does NOT open `r` transversal directions. We model `μ_n` as `ZMod n` (additively, `≅` the cyclic
group of order `n`) and the `j`-th power map as multiplication by `j`; its image is the subgroup
of index `gcd(j,n)`, of size `n / gcd(j,n)`. This proves the image size divides `n`. -/

holds for every even `j` since `n = 2^μ` is a 2-power — the image `n/gcd(j,n) < n` is a STRICT
subgroup: the Veronese coordinate collapses `μ_n` onto fewer than `n` points. A coordinate that is
not even injective cannot supply a transversal (general-position) direction; the per-class
`p^{−1/2}` Veronese-transversality gain T05 needs is geometrically absent. -/

`μ_{n/2}` (`gcd(2, 2^μ) = 2`).** So the SECOND Veronese coordinate already halves the point set —
the moment curve is maximally degenerate over a 2-power subgroup. -/

/-! ## Part III — the REDUCTION to F2 (the configuration-variety Weil wall, A04)

The architect's dichotomy: T05 closes the prize IFF the moment-curve transversality lowers the
primitive-part Weil weight from `2(r−1)` to `2(r−1)−1` (the extra `p^{−1/2}` per class). Parts I
and II show the mechanism is untenable:

* Part I: the "primitive part" `dim_prim` is empty (`= 0` in `ℕ`) for all prize depths `r ≥ 4` —
  there is no nonempty class set to transversalize.
* Part II: the Veronese coordinates fold `μ_n` into proper subgroups (zero net curvature) — even
  if the primitive part were nonempty, the curve supplies no general-position transversality.

So the primitive classes remain pure of weight `2(r−1)`, the configuration-variety Weil error
stays `p^{r−1}`, and we are exactly at the in-tree F2 wall: `_wfA04_weil_envelope_vacuity`
proves `(2r)^r · n^r ≤ C(2r,r) · (n^4)^{r−1}` at `β = 4` (the toric Weil envelope DOMINATES the
char-0 main term for `r ≥ 2`). We re-derive that domination here, self-contained, to certify the
landing fence.
-/

/-- **F2 landing (self-contained restatement of A04's `crude_le_pow4`).** At the prize `β = 4`
(`p = n^4`), for `2 ≤ r`, `2r ≤ n`: the crude char-0 ceiling `(2r)^r·n^r` is dominated by the
configuration-variety Weil weight `(n^4)^{r−1} = p^{r−1}`. Since the toric Betti `C(2r,r) ≥ 1`
multiplies `p^{r−1}`, the Weil error term is `Ω(char-0)`, never `o(char-0)`: the un-transversalized
config-variety bound is vacuous, which is precisely the F2 wall T05 reduces to. -/
theorem f2_weil_weight_dominates (n r : ℕ) (hr : 2 ≤ r) (hsmall : 2 * r ≤ n) :

/-- **The reduction, packaged as a conditional.** Model the T05 transversality claim as a
hypothesis `htrans : excess ≤ dimPrim` with `dimPrim := C(2r,r) − (2r−1)‼` (the `ℕ`-truncated
deficit). For `r ≥ 4` this forces `excess ≤ 0` (Part I, `dimPrimNat_eq_zero`). So the ONLY way
T05's bound is non-vacuous (`excess` could be a genuine positive `O_r(1)`) is at depths `r < 4`,
which are far below the prize depth `r ≈ ln q ≈ 83`. At the prize depth the claimed bound is
`excess ≤ 0`, contradicting any prime with positive spurious energy. Hence T05 supplies NO usable
energy-excess control at prize regime, and the residual stays on F2. -/
