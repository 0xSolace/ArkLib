# The sign `s_b` of the real period `η_b` carries NO character structure (#444, N13 sign-law wall)

**Frontier refutation brick (NON-MOMENT, EXTEND-proven, rule-4 cartography).**

The `_EtaRealNegClosed` brick proved that on the negation-closed prize subgroup `μ_n` (`n` even)
the incomplete Gauss period `η_b = Σ_{x∈μ_n} ψ(b·x)` is REAL, hence

> `η_b = s_b · ‖η_b‖`  with a SIGN `s_b ∈ {+1, −1}`  (`eta_eq_ofReal_re` ⟹ `arg η_b ∈ {0, π}`).

The strongest surviving "third route" (census §1.3 N13: the phase-aware contractive transfer
operator) was sharpened by `_EtaRealNegClosed` to a *discrete* object: the N13 "phase" is the sign
`s_b`. The companion `DilationRealSignCocycle` then reformulated the open core as a **real ±1 sign
cocycle**: a frequency stays on the non-cancelling doubling trajectory iff its descent signs are all
`+`, and the residual open content is the sign-cocycle large-deviation statement (no all-`+` descent
path survives). The natural hope for cracking THAT statement is that the sign pattern `b ↦ s_b` is
itself **multiplicatively structured**: a quadratic character, a Legendre symbol, or at least a
group homomorphism `F_p^* ⧸ μ_n → {±1}`. IF it were, the relative dilation sign `s_{ζb} / s_b`
(`ζ` of order `2n`) would be a CONSTANT independent of `b`, the sign cocycle would be a coboundary,
and the descent could be telescoped by a character argument.

This file REFUTES that hope (rule-4 cartography for the `DilationRealSignCocycle` residual): the
absolute sign `b ↦ s_b` is NOT a homomorphism, so the sign cocycle is NOT a coboundary and no
character/homomorphism descent on the sign can isolate the worst frequency or exclude the all-`+`
descent word.

## The probe verdict (rule 2, `scripts/probes/probe_eta_sign_qr_structure.py`)

Over the prize regime (proper thin `μ_n = 2^a`, `p ≫ n^3`, `p ≡ 1 (mod n)`, multiple primes incl.
Fermat-type, NEVER `n = q−1`):
* **H1** `s_b` is coset-constant on `F_p^* ⧸ μ_n`: TRUE (the object is well-defined).
* **H2** `s_b = Legendre(b ∣ p)`: ~45 to 63% agreement = pure NOISE. NOT the quadratic character.
* **H3** `s_b` multiplicative (`s_{b₁b₂} = s_{b₁}·s_{b₂}`): 36 to 69 failures / 120 pairs. MASSIVELY
  non-multiplicative. `b ↦ s_b` is NOT a homomorphism.
* **H4** relative dilation sign `s_{ζb}/s_b` constant in `b`: `{−1, +1}` (NOT constant) generically.

Explicit decidable witness (`probe_eta_sign_witness.py`): at `p = 89`, `μ_4 = {1,34,55,88}`,
`s_2 = +1` and `s_{4} = s_{2·2} = −1`, so `s_{2·2} ≠ s_2 · s_2`. The sign fails multiplicativity at
the smallest dilation `b₁ = b₂ = 2`.

## What this file proves (the abstract obstruction, axiom-clean)

The numeric facts above are real-analytic (transcendental cosine sums, not Lean-decidable). What IS
cleanly formalizable is the **mechanism**: a `{±1}` sign that fails multiplicativity at even one
single witness is NOT a `MonoidHom`, and consequently the relative-dilation sign `s(ζb)·s(b)` is NOT
independent of `b`, exactly the H4 obstruction. So no character/homomorphism descent on the sign
can isolate the worst frequency.

This is a CONSTRAINT on the open N13 lever (rule 4 cartography), NOT a bound on `M`. The
`√(n log(p/n))` core is untouched and OPEN: the sign carries no usable cancellation structure, which
is precisely why the magnitude side (wf-A1: children perfectly phase-aligned at `b*`,
`θ@b* = 0` exactly) cannot be saved by a sign argument, and the `DilationRealSignCocycle`
sign-cocycle large-deviation residual cannot be discharged by a character/coboundary argument.
NON-MOMENT (pure sign/character algebra, not an additive-energy route).

Axiom-clean (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`); no `sorry`. Issue #444.

a dilation `ζ` (i.e. the relative sign `s(ζ·b)·s(b)` would be the constant `s(ζ)` for every `b`),
then `s` cannot also fail multiplicativity at any pair involving that constant. Formalized: a
sign with a NON-constant relative-dilation factor `b ↦ s(ζ·b)·s(b)` is not multiplicative-by-`ζ`.
We state the contrapositive cleanly: if the relative-dilation factor takes two different values at
`b` and `b'`, then there is NO constant `c` with `s(ζ·b) = c·s(b)` for all `b` (so no homomorphism
descent on the dilation tower). -/

s_{b₂}` refutes that. We package: any concrete failure of multiplicativity rules out the
