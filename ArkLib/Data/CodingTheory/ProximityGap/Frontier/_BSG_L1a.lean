# `BSG L1a`: representation-function normalization `∑ r(x) = |A|²`

This is the L1a layer of the in-tree Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers attack. It proves the
*normalization identity* for the difference representation function `repCount` (the same `def`
as in `_BSG_L0`, reproduced here so this scratch file iterates against Mathlib alone):
$$ \sum_{x \in A - A} r(x) = |A|^2, \qquad r(x) = \#\{(a,b) \in A \times A : a - b = x\}. $$

This is the total ordered-pair count `|A|²`, partitioned by the difference of each pair, and is
the normalization used by L2 to bound the "unpopular" mass (`∑_{x unpopular} r(x)² < |A|³/(2K)`).

The proof is pure double counting: `Finset.sum_card_fiberwise_eq_card_filter` partitions
`A ×ˢ A` over the fibers of the difference map `(a,b) ↦ a - b` into `A - A`; every pair's
difference lies in `A - A` (`Finset.sub_mem_sub`), so the resulting filter is the whole product
`A ×ˢ A`, of cardinality `|A| · |A| = |A|²`.

The total number of ordered pairs in `A × A`, partitioned by their difference `a - b`. Each

fiber sizes is the size of the whole product `A ×ˢ A`. -/
