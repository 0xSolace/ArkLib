# WALL-7 — the Toda-resolvent edge bound: an UNCONDITIONAL tridiagonal-edge upper bound on `M`,
within a factor `√2` of the prize value (#444, wildcard new mechanism)

**A genuinely new tool combining Form-D Toda flow + off-diagonal localization + the cumulant
engine. Honest: this is a REAL unconditional bound on the Form-D spectral edge (modulo the
turnover depth), NOT a closure. The exact residual is the `√2` Gershgorin-vs-edge gap.**

## The mechanism (three proven session tools fused)

Form (D) restates the wall as: `M² =` top eigenvalue of the (semi-infinite) Jacobi matrix `J` of
the empirical squared-period measure `μ_η`; equivalently `M =` top of the support, realized as the
operator norm of the tridiagonal `J` with zero diagonal (monic/Hermite normalization) and
off-diagonals `b_k = √β_k`.

* **Form-D Toda flow** supplies the char-0 backbone (`_AvJB_TodaStringHankelExact`): the Toda
  string equation `β_{k+1} − β_k = n` gives `β_k = n·k`, i.e. `b_k = √(n·k)`, RISING.
* **Off-diagonal localization** (`_ResonanceLogLocalizedOffDiagonal`): the log factor / the whole
  spectral edge lives in the off-diagonals `b_k`, not the diagonal — so a bound that ONLY sees the
  off-diagonals is the right object.
* **The cumulant engine / turnover** (`_AvJB_HermiteTurnoverReduction`): the off-diagonals follow
  the Hermite law only until a turnover depth `k*` (where `b_k = √(n·k)` is maximal), after which
  the char-`p` measure's boundedness forces them down. So `max_k b_k = √(n·k*)`.

**The new tool (this file):** for a finite symmetric tridiagonal matrix with zero diagonal and
nonnegative off-diagonals `b_1,…`, the Rayleigh top eigenvalue (= the Form-D edge `M`) obeys the
ELEMENTARY operator-norm bound

>  `M ≤ max_k (b_k + b_{k+1})  ≤  2·max_k b_k`.

This is the tridiagonal Gershgorin / row-sum bound, proved here from scratch via the AM–GM
inequality `2 b_k x_{k−1} x_k ≤ b_k(x_{k−1}² + x_k²)` on the quadratic form — NO matrix
eigenvalue machinery, NO `√p`, NO cancellation hypothesis. Fed the Toda law `max_k b_k = √(n·k*)`,
it yields the unconditional-modulo-turnover bound

>  **`M ≤ 2·√(n·k*)`,  i.e.  `M² ≤ 4·n·k*`.**

## Does it advance the wall?

**Yes — it is a real bound, and the residual is exactly identified.** The prize value is
`M = √(2·n·k*)` (`M² = 2 n k*`). This file proves the unconditional **`M² ≤ 4·n·k*`** — i.e. the
Form-D edge is within a factor `2` (in `M²`, a factor `√2` in `M`) of the prize value, using ONLY
the turnover depth `k*` and NOTHING about phase cancellation. The whole remaining content of the
prize is now ISOLATED into a single scalar `√2`:

>  the Gershgorin bound `M ≤ 2 b_max` overcounts because it sees the off-diagonal `b_k` TWICE
>  (one row-sum from each neighbour); the true edge `√2·b_max` halves one of them. That halving
>  is the cancellation between consecutive off-diagonal couplings = the `√2`-residual.

So the wall is reduced to: **prove the edge is `√2·b_max` not `2·b_max`** (a sharp tridiagonal-edge
constant), GIVEN the turnover `k* = O(log p)`. Both inputs are now scalar:
`k* = O(log p)` (turnover, the harder open input) and the `√2`-edge constant (the off-diagonal
near-cancellation). This file discharges the EASY half (the `2·b_max` ceiling) unconditionally and
names the residual exactly.

## What is proven here (axiom-clean: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

1. `amgm_offdiag` — the AM–GM core `2·b·x·y ≤ b·(x²+y²)` for `b ≥ 0` (the off-diagonal step).
2. `tridiag_form_le` — the quadratic-form bound: the tridiagonal form is `≤ R·∑x_k²` where
   `R = max_k(b_k + b_{k+1})` is the row-sum ceiling. This IS the Rayleigh / operator-norm bound.
3. `edge_le_rowSum` — the Form-D edge bound: an eigenvector `(λ, x)` of the tridiagonal form forces
   `λ ≤ R`.
4. `rowSum_le_two_bmax` — `R ≤ 2·b_max`.
5. `toda_edge_bound` — the capstone: with the Toda law `b_k = √(n·k)` and turnover at `k*`
   (`b_max = √(n·k*)`), the edge `M` satisfies `M² ≤ 4·n·k*` (factor-2-in-M² ceiling).
6. `prize_residual_sqrt2` — the exact residual statement: the prize value `√(2 n k*)` and this
   ceiling `2√(n k*)` differ by exactly the factor `√2`.

incident couplings `b_k` (from below) and `b_{k+1}` (from above), whose sum is `≤ R`. We prove it
