# wf-S9b — the dyadic augmentation-parity certificate for the spurious mass (#444)

## The lane (2-adic / Gross–Koblitz side of `spur ⟺ p ∣ N(σ_T)`)

`spur config ⟺ p ∣ N(σ_T)` with `p` the SPLIT prize prime (odd, `p ≡ 1 mod n`). S9a decomposed
that *odd-prime* divisibility across the `φ(n)` split primes. S9b attacks the COMPLEMENTARY,
`p`-free side: the **2-adic** valuation `v_2(N(σ_T))`, which never sees the prize prime at all.

For `n = 2^μ` the prime `2` is **totally ramified** in `ℤ[ζ_n]`: `(2) = λ^{φ(n)}`, `λ = 1 − ζ`
the unique prime above `2`, residue degree `1`. Hence `v_2(N(σ_T)) = v_λ(σ_T)`. The reduction
`ℤ[ζ_n] → ℤ[ζ_n]/λ ≅ 𝔽_2` is the **augmentation** `ζ ↦ 1` (since `ζ ≡ 1 mod λ`): it sends a
signed config `σ_T = ∑_{i∈T} ε_i ζ^i` (each `ε_i ∈ {±1}`) to the residue of its **signed
coefficient sum** `∑_{i∈T} ε_i`. Because each `ε_i = ±1 ≡ 1 (mod 2)`, that signed sum has the
**same parity as the weight** `w = |T|`. Therefore:

  > **odd weight `w` ⟹ augmentation `≡ 1 ≠ 0` in `𝔽_2` ⟹ `λ ∤ σ_T` ⟹ `2 ∤ N(σ_T)`**, i.e.
  > `v_2(N(σ_T)) = 0`;  **even weight ⟹ `2 ∣ N(σ_T)`**, a forced `p`-free 2-adic floor.

This is a `p`-FREE, weight-graded constraint the spurious mass must obey, SHARPER than the
parity-blind archimedean house of S7 (`|N| ≤ w^{φ(n)}`).

## What S9b MEASURED (exact integer `Z[ζ]`-norms, `probe_wfS9_oneminuszeta.rs`)

Norm `N(σ_T)` computed exactly as the resultant `Res(σ_T(x), x^{n/2}+1)` (Bareiss, big-int), then
`v_2` read off. n = 16 (w ≤ 8) and n = 32 (w ≤ 4), ALL antipodal-free configs:

* **odd weight ⟹ `v_2(N) = 0` for EVERY config** (n=16: w∈{1,3,5,7}; n=32: w∈{1,3}); the norm is
  odd, the 2-adic part is empty. EXACT, no exceptions.
* **even weight ⟹ `v_2(N) ≥ 1` for EVERY config** (n=16: w∈{2,4,6,8}, floor =1, ranges up to 7 at
  the all-ones `w=8`; n=32: w∈{2,4}, floor =1). EXACT, no exceptions.

So the 2-adic valuation of the spurious mass is governed by a clean parity law, and a spur config
(`p ∣ N`, `p` odd) of ODD weight has `N` ODD: its `p`-divisibility is *purely odd-cyclotomic*, the
2-adic side carries no information. This isolates the odd-weight configs as the only place the
prize wall can live `2`-adically — the even-weight configs are pinned by the floor.

## What is PROVEN here (axiom-clean)

The augmentation-parity skeleton, representation-agnostic (any commutative ring `R` with a ring
hom `φ : R → ZMod 2`, the role of the reduction mod `λ`):

* **`augmentation_signed_sum`** : the augmentation of a signed config `∑_{i∈s} ε i • ζpow i` with
  every `ε i` mapping to `1` in `𝔽_2` equals `(s.card : ZMod 2)` — the signed sum has weight
  parity (the `ζ ↦ 1`, `ε_i ↦ 1` reduction).
* **`odd_weight_augmentation_unit`** : if the weight `s.card` is odd, the augmentation is `1` in
  `𝔽_2` (a unit) — the config is a `λ`-unit.
* **`not_dvd_of_augmentation_one`** : if a ring hom `φ : R → ZMod 2` sends `x` to `1`, then the
  characteristic-2 obstruction holds: any `y : R` with `φ y = 0` (i.e. `y ∈ ker φ = (λ)`) cannot
  equal `x`. Combined with `φ (2 : R) = 0`, this gives `2 ∤ x` whenever `φ x = 1` — the
  `v_2(N) = 0` consumer.
* **`two_not_dvd_of_odd_weight`** : the headline — under the named augmentation hypothesis, an
  odd-weight config is not divisible by `2` (`v_2 = 0`); the even floor is the contrapositive.

These say something the odd-prime split decomposition (S9a) and the archimedean house (S7) do NOT:
a `p`-FREE parity dichotomy on the 2-adic part of the spurious mass. The cyclotomic facts the
abstraction stands in for — that `ζ ↦ 1` is a ring hom to `𝔽_2 ≅ ℤ[ζ]/λ`, and that `2 ↦ 0` under
it (`2 = λ^{φ(n)} · unit`) — are supplied as the explicit named hypothesis `DyadicAugmentation`,
checked against the prize regime (`n = 2^μ`, the totally-ramified `(2) = λ^{φ(n)}`; NOT a `p > 2^n`
assumption — `p` does not appear).

Axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`, no new axiom. Issue #444.

the dyadic augmentation (the `n = 2^μ` totally-ramified structure), a signed config of ODD weight
is not divisible by `2`; equivalently its absolute norm `N(σ_T)` is odd, `v_2(N) = 0`. The MEASURED
law (`probe_wfS9_oneminuszeta`: odd weight ⟹ `v_2 = 0` for every config, n = 16, 32). The

/-- **Spur-isolation corollary.** A spur config (`p ∣ N`, `p` an ODD prime) of odd weight has `N`
odd: the 2-adic part of its spurious mass is empty, so the divisibility is *purely odd-cyclotomic*.
Formally: an odd-weight config under the dyadic augmentation is coprime to `2`, hence any prime
divisor of its norm contributing to the spur must be odd. This pins the odd-weight stratum as the
only `2`-adically-trivial home of the prize wall. -/
