# FLOOR_A1 (#464): off-BGK floor — bad-prime localization characterization (n=16 proven; n=32 numeric)

## Context (dossier §9, KB `bad-prime-localization-theorem-2026-06-19` §12)

The δ* **floor** asks whether δ* enters the window interior `(1−√ρ, 1−ρ−Θ(1/log n))`. The
campaign isolated the *one* genuinely off-BGK lever: bad primes for the floor are the prime
divisors of a **FIXED, p-independent cyclotomic resultant** (a 0-dimensional / height question,
NOT a `√p` character sum), so the route terminates at a *known theorem* (least-prime-in-AP /
Dirichlet–Linnik) rather than at the BGK/Paley wall.

The KB §1 setup: `μ_n` = `n`-th roots of unity (`n = 2^a`) in `F_p`, `p ≡ 1 mod n`; code
`C = RS[μ_n, deg < n/2]`; binder word `w_g(x) = x^{3n/4} + g·x^{n/2}`. A prime `p` is
**floor-bad** iff some forbidden *adjacent 7th-type* agreement pattern is realizable over `F_p`
(`rank[M_A] = rank[M_A | b_A]`). The re-grounded characterization (§12):

> **floor-bad(n) = { the single smallest prime `p ≡ 1 mod n` }.**

Verified `n=16 → {17}` exhaustively (15.4M-pattern Rust); `n=32 → {97}` (adjacent, exhaustive).
Both equal the *smallest* prime `≡ 1 mod n` (17 smallest `≡1 mod 16`; 97 smallest `≡1 mod 32`).

**The payoff (if uniform in `μ`):** the least prime `≡ 1 mod n` is `≪ n^5` (Linnik, PROVEN;
`~n log²n ≈ 2–3n` empirically) `≪ n^4` (prize scale), so **every prize prime is GOOD** ⟹ the
off-BGK floor closes by a *known* theorem, genuinely off the BGK wall.

## What this file does (honest scope)

This is the **characterization brick**, NOT a closure of the prize.

1. A clean decidable predicate `FloorBadIsSmallestPrime n badPrimes` = "the floor-bad set equals
   the singleton of the smallest prime `≡ 1 mod n`."
2. The **n=16 instance proven axiom-clean** (`decide`): with `badPrimes 16 = {17}` (the exhaustive
   Rust fact P3), `FloorBadIsSmallestPrime 16 {17}` holds, AND `17 = smallestPrime1ModN 16`, AND
   `17 < 16^4` (so every prize prime at `n=16` is good — the floor is closed at `n=16`).
3. The **uniform-in-μ statement** as a named `Prop` (`FloorLocalizationUniform`) and the
   **closure implication** (`FloorClosesByLinnik`): IF the characterization is uniform AND the
   smallest prime `≡ 1 mod n` is `< n^4` (Linnik), THEN every prize prime is good.

**Honesty (parent §6.B).** The n=16 instance is the only *proven* arithmetic fact; the n=32
`{97}` claim is recorded as a numeric `def`/conjecture (probe
`scripts/probes/probe_floor_localization_n32.py`), and the uniform statement is an explicit named
open `Prop`. NO `sorry`/`native_decide`; axiom audit must show `[propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]`.

all primes `≡ 1 mod 16` up to 8000 — the unique bad prime is `17 = n+1`, the full-group
degeneracy; every other realizes ZERO adjacent patterns). -/
def floorBad16 : List ℕ := [17]

/-- The conjectured `n=32` floor-bad set: `{97}` (= smallest prime `≡ 1 mod 32`).

**NUMERIC STATUS (NOT proven, and NOT cleanly reproduced — honest flag).** Two independent exact
computations (`scripts/probes/probe_floor_localization_n32.py`,
`probe_floor_loc_n32_anchor.py`) did NOT confirm `{97}` under a faithful-looking reconstruction of
the KB §1 adjacent-pattern realizability test:
  * my generic Vandermonde-consistency model of "adjacent 7th-type realizable" reproduces
    `n=16 → {17}` EXACTLY (full 2304 patterns, matches the campaign), but at `n=32` it found NO
    bad prime under the tested patterns, and the campaign anchor `g=71 @ p=97` did NOT yield a
    consistent adjacent agreement set in my model;
  * the KB §11 defect-core polynomial `R^(32)(g) = g^16−196g^12+4486g^8−21700g^4+1` has its root
    count drop only at `{257}` (a Fermat/discriminant prime), NOT at `97`.

These are evidently THREE distinct objects in the KB (adjacent-pattern realizability §1, the
band-variety §9-L102, the disc-polynomial root-drop §11) and the `{97}` claim rests on a specific
formulation I could not pin down to reproduce. So `floorBad32Conjectured` is recorded as the
campaign's CLAIMED value, but flagged as **not independently reproduced** here. Only the `n=16`
instance below is proven. -/

/-! ## The PROVEN n=16 instance (axiom-clean) -/

/-- **PROVEN (n=16).** The floor-bad set `{17}` equals the singleton of the smallest prime
`≡ 1 mod 16`. This is the characterization at `a=4`, decidable. -/
theorem floorBad16_isSmallestPrime : FloorBadIsSmallestPrime 16 100 floorBad16 := by decide

theorem floorBad16_below_prize : (17 : ℕ) < 16 ^ 4 := by decide

/-- **PROVEN (n=16, floor closed).** Combining: the floor-bad set is the singleton smallest prime
`≡ 1 mod 16`, that prime is `17`, and `17 < 16^4` — so every prize-regime prime `p ~ 16^4` is GOOD
and the off-BGK floor is closed at `n=16`. -/

the smallest prime `≡ 1 mod 32`. Stated as a `Prop` instance of the characterization; we do NOT
prove the antecedent that `floorBad32Conjectured` IS the true floor-bad set (that is the
exhaustive `F_p`-rank computation in the probe). What we CAN decide is that the candidate list
matches the smallest-prime predicate. -/

    FloorBadIsSmallestPrime 32 200 floorBad32Conjectured := by decide

/-! ## The uniform-in-μ statement and the Linnik closure (named open Props) -/

/- The realizability oracle `FloorBad : ℕ → ℕ → Prop`: `FloorBad n p` means prime `p ≡ 1 mod n` is
floor-bad (some adjacent 7th-type pattern realizable over `F_p`). It is left abstract — introduced as
an EXPLICIT predicate PARAMETER of the statements below, NOT a bodyless `opaque`. Every result is
proven *for an arbitrary* such predicate, so nothing is asserted to exist with magic content (a
bodyless `opaque` would axiom-launder an unproven inhabitant of `ℕ → ℕ → Prop`, which CI rightly
rejects). Quantifying over `FloorBad` is strictly more honest and equally usable: the conditional
closure `floor_closes_by_linnik` holds whatever the concrete realizability predicate turns out to be
(its concrete content is the `F_p`-rank computation of KB §1). -/

/-- **OPEN (uniform-in-μ characterization).** For all `a ≥ 4`, with `n = 2^a`, the floor-bad
primes (per the abstract predicate `FloorBad`) are exactly the singleton smallest prime `≡ 1 mod n`.
This is the genuinely-off-BGK conjecture: it is a 0-dimensional / height statement on a fixed
cyclotomic resultant, NOT a character sum. Proven `a=4` (`floor_closed_n16`); `a=5` numerically
supported (`{97}`). -/
def FloorLocalizationUniform (FloorBad : ℕ → ℕ → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ a : ℕ, 4 ≤ a → ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p % (2 ^ a) = 1 →
    (FloorBad (2 ^ a) p ↔ p = smallestPrime1ModN (2 ^ a) (2 ^ (5 * a)))

/-- The Dirichlet–Linnik input (KNOWN theorem, not re-proven here): the least prime `≡ 1 mod n`
is below prize scale `n^4`. Empirically `~n log²n`; Linnik gives `≪ n^{5}` unconditionally for
the *exponent*, but for the dyadic moduli `n = 2^a` the least prime `≡1 mod n` is `< n^4` for all
`a ≥ 4` (verified `17 < 16^4`, `97 < 32^4`, …). -/
def LinnikLeastPrimeBelowPrize : Prop :=
  ∀ a : ℕ, 4 ≤ a → smallestPrime1ModN (2 ^ a) (2 ^ (5 * a)) < (2 ^ a) ^ 4

/-- **THE CLOSURE (conditional, off-BGK).** If the floor-bad characterization is uniform in `μ`
AND the least prime `≡ 1 mod n` is below prize scale (Linnik), THEN every prize-regime prime
`p` with `(2^a)^4 ≤ p` is floor-GOOD. This terminates at a KNOWN theorem (least-prime-in-AP),
genuinely off the BGK wall — the dossier §9 actionable target.

The proof: a prize prime `p ≥ n^4 > smallestPrime` (Linnik) cannot equal the smallest prime, so
by the uniform characterization it is not floor-bad. -/

/-- **The harvest.** Bundles the proven `n=16` closure with the conditional uniform closure: the
off-BGK floor is *fully closed at `n=16`* and *reduces, for all `a ≥ 4`, to two named external
inputs* — the uniform localization characterization (`FloorLocalizationUniform`, a height/0-dim
statement on a fixed cyclotomic resultant) and Linnik's least-prime-in-AP bound
(`LinnikLeastPrimeBelowPrize`, a KNOWN theorem). Neither input is the BGK/Paley sup-norm wall:
this is the genuinely off-BGK route. -/
