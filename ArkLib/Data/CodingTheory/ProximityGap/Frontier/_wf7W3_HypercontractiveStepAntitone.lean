# W3: the hypercontractive **step-ratio antitonicity** ladder ⟹ the Gaussian step-law (#444, wf-W3)

## The lead (sub-Gaussian / hypercontractivity on the dyadic cube)

The DC-subtracted Gauss periods `{η_b/√n}_{b≠0}` of the dyadic subgroup `μ_n` (`n = 2^μ`) are
**sub-Gaussian** with variance proxy ≈ `n` (the Gaussian value). The W3 strategy is Bonami–Beckner /
log-Sobolev hypercontractivity on the dyadic structure: a sub-Gaussian variable's even-moment
sequence `M_{2r}` obeys the Gaussian step-law `M_{2(r+1)} ≤ (2r+1)·s·M_{2r}` (`s = n` the proxy),
which the in-tree telescope `WF6F1.gaussian_moment_bound_of_stepLaw` converts to the full Wick bound
`M_{2r} ≤ (2r-1)‼·s^r`, i.e. the floor `A_r ≤ Wick_r`.

This file does **not** re-prove the telescope. It supplies the **sharper hypercontractive reduction
of the step-law itself**, the W3 deliverable. Define the *normalized* step ratio

> `R(r) := M(r+1) / ((2r+1)·s·M(r))`     (the cumulant / hypercontractive ratio; `R ≡ 1` for `N(0,s)`).

The Gaussian step-law is exactly `R(r) ≤ 1 ∀r`. Lane-W3 exact numerics
(`scripts/probes/probe_wf7W3_*` / `scripts/probes/rust/`, exact `cos`-period sums over `F_p`,
`β ≈ 4..5.3`, depth `r ≈ 1.6·ln q`, `n = 16..256`) measured the decisive structural fact:

* `R(r)` is **antitone** (monotone non-increasing) in `r` across the whole prize regime, and its
  supremum is attained at `r = 1`, where `R(1) = M_4/(3·s·M_2) ≤ 0.99 < 1`.  (Equivalently, the
  `ψ₂`-moment constant `K_eff(r) = (M_{2r}/[(2r-1)‼ s^r])^{1/r}` is monotone decreasing with
  `sup_r K_eff(r) = K_eff(1) = M_2/s ≈ 1`.)

So the open step-law `R(r) ≤ 1 ∀r` reduces to TWO hypercontractive facts:
  (W3-base)  `R(1) ≤ 1`  — the **second-/fourth-moment** inequality `M_4 ≤ 3·s·M_2` (a fixed, finite
             check; the `r=1` Parseval/hypercontractive base, NOT a deep-moment statement); and
  (W3-anti)  `R` antitone — the **cumulant-ratio monotonicity**, the genuine log-Sobolev /
             Bonami–Beckner content of the dyadic cube.

This is **sharper** than the prior per-step `GaussianStepLaw` (all-`r`) and than
`WickMonotonicityReduction.WickMonotonicity`: it pins the open content to a *monotonicity of one
explicit ratio* anchored at a *single base inequality*, exactly the hypercontractive object.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean, pure-math ladder)

* `NormStepRatio` — the normalized step ratio `R(r)` as a sequence (guarded against `M r = 0`).
* `StepRatioAntitone` — the named hypercontractive hypothesis: `R(r+1) ≤ R(r)` for `r ≥ 1`.
* `stepLaw_of_antitone_base` — **THE LADDER** (axiom-clean): from positivity of `M`, the base
  `R(1) ≤ 1` and `StepRatioAntitone`, derive the full `WF6F1.GaussianStepLaw M s`.
* `gaussian_moment_bound_of_antitone_base` — composes the ladder with the in-tree telescope to land
  `M r ≤ (2r-1)‼·s^r` for ALL `r` from `[R(1)≤1] + [R antitone]` (+ base `M 0 ≤ 1`).

Honest scope (the wall): `(W3-anti)` (the cumulant-ratio antitonicity) is the remaining OPEN analytic
input — it is *empirically true and β-conditional* (robust for prize `β ≈ 5.27`; the same
small-`β ≈ 2` violation flagged in F1 applies). This file is the **deductive producer** turning the
open floor into that single monotonicity, NOT a closure. The base `(W3-base)` `M_4 ≤ 3 s M_2` is a
finite hypercontractive fact (the `r=1` face, `A_1 < n` is `SecondMomentExact.base_case_strict` for
the *un-normalized* second moment; the fourth-moment cap is the new finite check).

/-- The **normalized Gaussian step ratio** of a moment sequence `M` with variance proxy `s`:
`R(r) = M(r+1) / ((2r+1)·s·M(r))`. For a real Gaussian `N(0,s)` this is identically `1`
(`M(r)=(2r-1)‼ s^r`); the hypercontractive lead asserts the dyadic periods have `R ≤ 1`. -/

/-- The **hypercontractive antitonicity** hypothesis (W3-anti): the normalized step ratio is

`M(r+1) ≤ (2r+1)·s·M(r)` whenever `M r > 0` and `(2r+1)·s ≥ 0`. -/

/-- **THE HYPERCONTRACTIVE LADDER.** With `s > 0` and `M r > 0` for all `r`, the base `R(1) ≤ 1` and
the antitonicity `StepRatioAntitone` together give `R(r) ≤ 1` for every `r ≥ 1`, hence the full
`GaussianStepLaw` for `r ≥ 1`. (At `r = 0` the step `M 1 ≤ 1·s·M 0` is the variance base, supplied
separately; see `gaussian_moment_bound_of_antitone_base`.)

This is the W3 reduction: the open all-`r` step-law collapses to ONE base inequality + ONE
monotonicity, the natural hypercontractive object. Axiom-clean. -/

/-- **W3 end-to-end via the in-tree telescope.** From positivity, the variance base
`M 1 ≤ s·M 0`, the hypercontractive base `R(1) ≤ 1`, the antitonicity `StepRatioAntitone`, and
`M 0 ≤ 1`, the full sub-Gaussian Wick bound `M r ≤ (2r-1)‼·s^r` holds for ALL `r`.

Mechanism: the ladder `normStepRatio_le_one_of_antitone_base` gives `R(r) ≤ 1 ∀ r ≥ 1`, i.e. the
Gaussian step at every `r ≥ 1`; together with the `r = 0` variance step this is the full
`WF6F1.GaussianStepLaw`, which the proven telescope `WF6F1.gaussian_moment_bound_of_stepLaw`
converts to the Wick bound. The open content is now exactly `(W3-base) R(1) ≤ 1` (finite) and
`(W3-anti) StepRatioAntitone` (the cumulant-ratio monotonicity). -/
