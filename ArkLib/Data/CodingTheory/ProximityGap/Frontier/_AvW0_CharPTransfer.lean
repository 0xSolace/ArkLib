# Char-`p` transfer of the char-0 Wick bound: good-prime moment bound to depth `r₀(n)` (#444, W0)

This brick wires the **proven** `r`-uniform char-0 Wick bound
`E_r^{char0}(μ_n) ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r` (`_AvW0_BesselWickDomination.charZeroWick_bound_allR`) through the
**No-Excess decomposition** `E_r^{𝔽_p}(μ_n) = E_r^{char0}(μ_n) + W_r` into a moment bound over
`𝔽_p`, honestly delimited to the good-prime / shallow-depth regime where `W_r = 0`.

## The transfer (paper)

The `2r`-th moment of the largest character sum satisfies `M^{2r} ≤ p·E_r^{𝔽_p}(μ_n) − n^{2r}`
(Parseval/moment identity, in-tree). With `E_r^{𝔽_p} = E_r^{char0} + W_r` (No-Excess) and the
char-0 Wick bound:

  `M^{2r} ≤ p·(E_r^{char0} + W_r) − n^{2r} ≤ p·(2r−1)‼·n^r + p·W_r − n^{2r}`.

**(a) Good-prime regime (`W_r = 0`, `r ≤ r₀(n)`):** the `p·W_r` term vanishes, so
`M^{2r} ≤ p·(2r−1)‼·n^r`, i.e. `M ≤ (p·(2r−1)‼·n^r)^{1/2r}`. The exact-integer recompute below
(memory `issue444-Wr-excess-onset-threshold`, re-verified) gives the onset:

  - `n = 16`: `W_r = 0` at all 11 generic (non-Fermat) primes for `r ≤ 4`; `r₀(16) ∈ (4,6)`.
  - `n = 32`: `W_r = 0` for `r ≤ 4`; `r₀(32) ∈ (4,5)`.

  At `r = r₀ = 4`, `β = 4` (`p = n^4`), the bound gives `M ≤ (n^4·105·n^4)^{1/8} = 105^{1/8}·n`,
  exponent `≈ 1.21` in `n` (`n=16`) / `1.17` (`n=32`) — i.e. the char-0 Wick bound is real and
  TRANSFERS, but at *shallow fixed* depth `r₀` it does NOT reach the `√(n log p)` form, which
  needs `r ≈ ln p`.

**(b) The wall (`r ≈ ln p > r₀(n)`):** here `W_r > 0` (onset crossed), the `p·W_r` term is
positive and the bound `M ≤ √2·√(n log p)` FAILS. This is exactly the BGK char-`p` wall —
the `W_r` excess at the moment-saddle is the for-all-`q` prize obstruction. UNTOUCHED.

## What this proves (axiom-clean `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`, non-vacuous)

- `goodPrime_moment_bound`: from the No-Excess decomposition with `W_r = 0` and the char-0 Wick
  bound, `M^{2r} ≤ p·(2r−1)‼·n^r − n^{2r} + n^{2r}` — i.e. `Mpow ≤ p·(2r−1)‼·(2m)^r` whenever
  `Mpow ≤ p·E𝔽p − (2m)^{2r} + (2m)^{2r}` and `E𝔽p = Echar0 + W` with `W = 0` and the Wick bound
  holds. Stated as a clean arithmetic implication (the hypotheses are the named in-tree facts).
- `forallQ_gap`: the named obligation `WrPositiveAtSaddle` — at `r ≈ ln p` the excess `W_r > 0`,
  so the transferred bound is void; this is the residual BGK wall. NOT discharged.

## Honest scope (`closesPrize = false`)

The char-0 Wick bound is proven `r`-uniformly. Its char-`p` transfer is conditional on `W_r = 0`,
which holds ONLY up to the onset `r₀(n)` (shallow). The prize needs the moment bound at the saddle
`r ≈ ln p ≫ r₀`, where `W_r > 0`. This brick closes none of #444; it pins precisely the boundary.

Issue #444.

says `W > 0`, so `NoExcessDecomp EFp Echar0 0` fails (would force `W = 0`). We record the logical
fact that `W = 0` and `0 < W` are contradictory — i.e. the transfer cannot hold at the saddle. -/
