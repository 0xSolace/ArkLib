# Door-(iv): the prize is equivalent to a worst-`b` half-mass `L¹` bound (#444)

Continuing the half-mass thread (`_DoorIVHalfMassFactorization`): write `M(n) = max_b ‖η_b‖` for the
prize object and `H(n) = max_b (‖A_b‖ + ‖B_b‖)` for the worst-`b` half-mass `L¹` of the index-2
coset-half split.  Two facts pin `M` and `H` to the same scale:

* `M ≤ H` **always** (coherence ≤ 1, i.e. `‖A+B‖ ≤ ‖A‖+‖B‖` pointwise, so the max transfers) —
  proven in `_DoorIVHalfMassFactorization.norm_le_halfMass`.
* `H ≤ C·M` for an absolute constant `C ≈ 1` (probe `probe_dooriv_halfmass_equiv.py`: `H/M = 1.00`
  at `n=16,64` full/near-full scan, `1.11` at `n=32` sampled; `H` and `M` coincide).

This file records the abstract **reduction**: under those two bounds, a prize-shaped bound on `M`
is equivalent (up to the constant `C`) to the same-shaped bound on `H`.  So the open door-(iv) target
can be **restated entirely in terms of the half-mass** `H(n)` — the citable reduction
`prize ⟺ H(n) = O(√(n·log(p/n)))`.

Scope: order arithmetic over `ℝ`.  No CORE/cancellation/capacity claim — this is the reduction wrapper,
with the analytic content (the bound on `H` itself) left open exactly as before.

bounded by `C · scale`, then the prize `M` is bounded by `C · scale`. -/

`H ≤ K · M` and the prize `M` is bounded by `C · scale`, then the half-mass is bounded by `K·C·scale`. -/

/-- **Prize ⟺ half-mass bound (up to constants).**  Given the always-true `M ≤ H` and the probed
reverse `H ≤ K·M` (`K ≈ 1`), the existence of an absolute prize constant is equivalent to the existence
of an absolute half-mass constant: a prize-shaped bound on `M` and the same-shaped bound on `H` imply
each other up to the factor `K`.  (Pointwise rung: for a single positive scale a `C` can be picked
trivially, so the genuine Big-O statement is the uniform-family form
`exists_prizeFamilyBound_iff_exists_halfMassFamilyBound` below, which fixes one constant across all `n`.) -/

/-- Quantitative envelope form: `M` and `H` are sandwiched `M ≤ H ≤ K·M`, so they are within the
factor `K` of each other — the half-mass is an equivalent target, not merely an upper envelope. -/

    M ≤ H ∧ H ≤ K * M :=

/-- **Normalized half-mass corridor.**  At any positive prize scale, the pointwise sandwich
`M ≤ H ≤ K·M` transfers unchanged to the normalized ratios: the half-mass Shaw-value ratio is between
the prize ratio and `K` times the prize ratio.  Thus normalization by `√(n log(p/n))` does not create a
new lever; it preserves exactly the same comparison constant. -/

/-! ## Uniform-family form: the genuine absolute-constant (Big-O) reduction

The pointwise `prizeBound_iff_halfMassBound` above is, for a single positive scale, satisfiable by a
pointwise `C` and so does NOT by itself capture an absolute Big-O constant.  The family forms below
require ONE constant across the whole admissible index family `ι` (the fields / subgroup sizes), which
IS the `prize ⟺ H(n)=O(scale)` statement. -/

/-- A uniform normalized prize-family bound: one constant `C` bounds `M / scale` for every index.
This is the Shaw-value form of `prizeFamilyBound` when `scale = √(n log(p/n))`. -/

/-- **Normalized uniform-family half-mass reduction.**  Under one family-wide comparison constant
`K` and positive scales, bounded normalized prize ratios are equivalent to bounded normalized half-mass
ratios.  This is the Shaw-value version of
`exists_prizeFamilyBound_iff_exists_halfMassFamilyBound`: normalization by the prize scale preserves
the exact same door-(iv) reduction and adds no hidden analytic lever. -/

/-- **Uniform-family door-(iv) reduction (the Big-O statement).**  Given, over the whole index family,
the always-true `M i ≤ H i` and the probed reverse `H i ≤ K · M i` with a SINGLE constant `K ≥ 0`, the
existence of an absolute prize constant is equivalent to the existence of an absolute half-mass
constant.  This is the honest `prize ⇔ H(n)=O(scale)`: one constant for all `n`, not pointwise. -/
