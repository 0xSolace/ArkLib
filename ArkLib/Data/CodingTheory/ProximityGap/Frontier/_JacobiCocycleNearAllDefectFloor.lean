# Near-all-defect CS floor is only complement-size

**Door (iv), Lane 3 — strengthens the CS/L²-budget refutation near the adversarial regime.**

`_JacobiCocycleAllDefectCSVacuous` proved that the k-defect Cauchy–Schwarz floor

`((M - k) · D) / M`, where `D = ∑_{i∈S}(1 - Re w_i)`, is exactly zero at full defect cardinality
`k=M`. This file records the nearby quantitative obstruction: even when the defect set misses `r=M-k`
indices, the CS floor is bounded by `2r`. Thus the Cauchy–Schwarz/L² route only gives an
`O(complement-size)` certificate near the all-defect regime, not a prize-scale dispersion theorem.

Probe: `scripts/probes/probe_dooriv_near_all_defect_floor.py` checked `M=1..256` and every `k`; the
worst ratio approaches `1` as `k/M → 1`, so the `2(M-k)` ceiling is sharp up to the endpoint factor.

## HONEST SCOPE
This is a constraint lemma for the k-defect CS floor, not a CORE bound. It explains why the floor that is
useful for sparse defects cannot survive the adversarial all/near-all-defect phase configuration. Any real
Door-IV crack still needs arithmetic anti-concentration of the monomial phases, not this L² budget. No CORE,
cancellation, completion, moment-saving, anti-concentration, or capacity claim.

/-- **The k-defect CS floor is at most twice the complement size.** For unit defect phases and
`#S ≤ M`, the floor from `_JacobiCocycleKDefectQuantDeficit`,
`((M - #S) * D) / M`, is bounded by `2*(M-#S)`. Near the all-defect regime this is only
`O(M-#S)`, and at `S=univ` it recovers the exact zero floor. -/

floor is at most `2R`. A small complement cannot yield more than a small absolute floor from this route. -/

/-- **Inverse spend obligation for near-all-defect CS floors.** Any claimed lower certificate `T` from the
k-defect CS floor forces at least `T/2` missing indices outside the defect set. Thus a prize-sized floor
cannot be hidden in a near-all-defect configuration unless the complement itself is prize-sized. -/
