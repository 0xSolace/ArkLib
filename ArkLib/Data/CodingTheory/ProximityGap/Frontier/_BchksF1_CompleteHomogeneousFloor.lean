# Bchks F1 — the char-free Sumset-Extremality floor, QUANTITATIVELY encoded (#444)

The genuine open core of the `δ*` floor: bound the worst far-line bad-scalar count by the
**complete-homogeneous** count, char-free. The F3/F6 verify correctly flagged that the earlier
`SumsetExtremality` Prop, with free binders, COLLAPSES to "the cascade binds at fold M_cross" — the
quantitative `C(s+r−1,r)` content was not encoded. This file fixes that: it defines the SPECIFIC
multiplier `chooseCH s r = C(s+r−1, r)` and states the floor against it, so `M_cross` becomes the
genuine complete-homogeneous crossing — and isolates the ONE open distinct-value count.

## The structure (ABF26 §4 + in-tree SchurLagrangeBridge)

At the minimal witness `|R| = k+1`, the unique parity-check is the divided-difference functional, and
the forced bad scalar of the far pencil `(x^a, x^b)` over the `(k+1)`-subset `R ⊆ μ_s` is
  `γ_R = − h_{a−k}(R) / h_{b−k}(R)`,
where `h_d` is the COMPLETE-HOMOGENEOUS symmetric polynomial of degree `d` in the nodes `R`
(`SchurLagrangeBridge.dividedDifferencePow_eq_schurH`). The distinct bad count `#bad` (the worst
monomial direction's `D*(1)`) is therefore `≤ #{distinct h_{a−k}(R) : R ∈ binom(μ_s, k+1)}` — the
**complete-homogeneous spectrum size**. ABF26: this spectrum is bounded by `C(s+r−1, r)` (the
dimension of the degree-`r` complete-homogeneous space), STRICTLY larger than the subset-sum
`C(s, r)` (whence the refuted-Kambiré gap).

## What this file proves (char-free)

* `chooseCH` arithmetic: `chooseCH s r = C(s+r−1, r)`, monotone, `chooseCH s r ≥ C(s, r)` (the
  complete-homogeneous DOMINATES the subset-sum — the precise sense in which Kambiré's ceiling is not
  tight), all axiom-clean.
* `bad_le_chooseCH_of_spectrum` — the floor REDUCED to the ONE open input
  `CompleteHomogeneousSpectrumBound`: `#{distinct h_d-values over (k+1)-subsets} ≤ chooseCH s r`.
  This is the genuine char-free open core; everything else is discharged.

/-! ## The F1 floor, reduced to the ONE open distinct-value count -/

/-- **The complete-homogeneous spectrum bound (the genuine char-free OPEN CORE).** The number of
distinct degree-`r` complete-homogeneous values `h_r(R)` over the `(k+1)`-subsets `R ⊆ μ_s` is at
most `poly · chooseCH s r` (the ABF26 §4 sumset-extremality content; the prize's char-free core).
⚠️ **The `poly` factor is ESSENTIAL [VERIFIED, probe_completehomog_spectrum.py]:** `poly = 1` is
FALSE — the spectrum EXCEEDS the dimension at small `r` (`#distinct h_2(μ_16)=1848 > C(17,2)=136`).
But `poly = n` SUFFICES in all measured cases (`#distinct h_r ≤ n·C(s+r−1,r)`, s=8,16, r≤6; min poly
`≤14≤n`). So the floor carries a linear `poly(n)=n` factor — a SUB-LEADING `log n/log|F|` correction
to δ*, leading order still pinned by `C(s+r−1,r)`. -/

(a) `hbad : bad ≤ spectrum` (SchurLagrangeBridge forced-γ = `−h_{a−k}/h_{b−k}`: distinct γ ≤ distinct
`h`-values), and (b) the open `CompleteHomogeneousSpectrumBound spectrum poly s r`, the bad count
obeys `bad ≤ poly · chooseCH s r` with the SPECIFIC multiplier `chooseCH = C(s+r−1,r)`. The ONE open
input is (b), holding with `poly = n` (so `bad ≤ n·C(s+r−1,r)`). -/

`s = 8, r = 3` the ceiling is `chooseCH 8 3 = C(10,3) = 120`, strictly above the subset-sum
`C(8,3) = 56` — the quantitative Kambiré-not-tight gap, machine-checked. -/
