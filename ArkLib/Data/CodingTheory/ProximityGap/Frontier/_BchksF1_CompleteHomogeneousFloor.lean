# Bchks F1 — the char-free Sumset-Extremality floor, QUANTITATIVELY encoded (#444)

The genuine open core of the `δ*` floor: bound the worst far-line bad-scalar count by the
**complete-homogeneous** count, char-free. The F3/F6 verify correctly flagged that the earlier
`SumsetExtremality` Prop, with free binders, COLLAPSES to "the cascade binds at fold M_cross" — the
quantitative `C(s+r−1,r)` content was not encoded. This file fixes that: it defines the SPECIFIC
multiplier `chooseCH s r = C(s+r−1, r)` and states the floor against it, so `M_cross` becomes the
genuine complete-homogeneous crossing — and isolates the ONE open distinct-value count.

## The structure (ABF26 §4 + in-tree SchurLagrangeBridge)

At the minimal witness `|R| = k+1`, the unique parity-check is the divided-difference functional, and
the forced bad scalar of the far pencil `(x^a, x^b)` over the `(k+1)`-subset `R ⊆ μ_s` is
  `γ_R = − h_{a−k}(R) / h_{b−k}(R)`,
where `h_d` is the COMPLETE-HOMOGENEOUS symmetric polynomial of degree `d` in the nodes `R`
(`SchurLagrangeBridge.dividedDifferencePow_eq_schurH`). The distinct bad count `#bad` (the worst
monomial direction's `D*(1)`) is therefore `≤ #{distinct h_{a−k}(R) : R ∈ binom(μ_s, k+1)}` — the
**complete-homogeneous spectrum size**. ABF26: this spectrum is bounded by `C(s+r−1, r)` (the
dimension of the degree-`r` complete-homogeneous space), STRICTLY larger than the subset-sum
`C(s, r)` (whence the refuted-Kambiré gap).

## What this file proves (char-free)

* `chooseCH` arithmetic: `chooseCH s r = C(s+r−1, r)`, monotone, `chooseCH s r ≥ C(s, r)` (the
  complete-homogeneous DOMINATES the subset-sum — the precise sense in which Kambiré's ceiling is not
  tight), all axiom-clean.
* `bad_le_chooseCH_of_spectrum` — the floor REDUCED to the ONE open input
  `CompleteHomogeneousSpectrumBound`: `#{distinct h_d-values over (k+1)-subsets} ≤ chooseCH s r`.
  This is the genuine char-free open core; everything else is discharged.

/-! ## The F1 floor, reduced to the ONE open distinct-value count -/

/-- **The complete-homogeneous spectrum bound (the genuine char-free OPEN CORE).** The number of
distinct degree-`r` complete-homogeneous values `h_r(R)` over the `(k+1)`-subsets `R ⊆ μ_s` is at
most `chooseCH s r = C(s+r−1, r)`. Modeled abstractly: `spectrum` is the distinct-value count (a
`Finset.card`), and the claim is `spectrum ≤ chooseCH s r`. THIS is the ABF26 §4 sumset-extremality
content — NOT discharged here; it is the prize's char-free core. -/

/-- **F1 — the char-free floor, REDUCED to the spectrum bound.** GIVEN (a) the bad-count is bounded
by the complete-homogeneous spectrum (`hbad : bad ≤ spectrum`, the SchurLagrangeBridge forced-γ =
`−h_{a−k}/h_{b−k}` structure: distinct γ ≤ distinct `h`-values), and (b) the open spectrum bound
`CompleteHomogeneousSpectrumBound spectrum s r`, the bad-scalar count obeys the char-free
Sumset-Extremality ceiling `bad ≤ poly · chooseCH s r` with `poly = 1` (the SPECIFIC quantitative
multiplier `chooseCH = C(s+r−1,r)`, fixing the F3/F6 placeholder). The ONE genuine open input is the
spectrum bound (b). -/

`C(8,3) = 56` — the quantitative Kambiré-not-tight gap, machine-checked. -/
