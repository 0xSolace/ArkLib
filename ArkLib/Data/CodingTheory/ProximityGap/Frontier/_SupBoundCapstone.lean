# The corrected central conditional: prize ⟸ a SUP/existence wraparound bound (#444)

The thesis's first capstone (`_ThesisCapstone.subPoisson_variance_implies_prizeFloor`) reduced the
prize to a **variance** hypothesis (sub-Poisson wraparound over the prime family).  This session
refuted that hypothesis empirically (`_OverdispersionObstructsVariance`: the wraparound is heavily
over-dispersed, `Var/mean = 14 … 407000`) — *but* showed the over-dispersion is **benign**
(`overdispersion_is_benign`): the prize needs only a **sup / existence** bound on the wraparound at
the *chosen* prime, a different statistic that over-dispersion never violates.  The thin-and-above-onset
probe confirms it: every computable prime is good with `> 99.4 %` margin, including the Fermat prime.

This brick records the *corrected* central conditional, axiom-clean and self-contained: the prize floor
follows from a **single good prime** — `W_r(p*) ≤ slack` at one admissible prime (existence), or
uniformly over the family (sup) — with **no variance hypothesis at all**.  This is the honest version of
the thesis's central positive claim (§7.6(iii)): the reduction is to the supremum of the wraparound,
not its variance.

The chain is the one already carried by `_ProveAssemblyConcrete`: a good prime gives the char-`p`
energy `≤ Wick`, which the monotone saddle turns into `M ≤ prize floor`.  Here we abstract the saddle
as a hypothesis `hsaddle` and the energy split `E = E0 + W` so the logical core — *existence of one good
prime suffices* — is exposed cleanly and is manifestly independent of any second-moment behaviour.

/-- Per-prime char-`p` energy of `μ_n` = char-0 energy `E0` plus the wraparound surplus `W i` at the

/-- **The corrected capstone (pointwise form).**  At any prime `i` whose wraparound clears the slack
(`W i ≤ slack`), the saddle value `M (energy …)` is `≤` the prize floor — **provided only** the
budget `E0 + slack ≤ Wick` and the monotone saddle `hsaddle`.  No variance, no averaging: a single
good prime suffices.  This is exactly the reduction `_ProveAssemblyConcrete` performs, with the
energy-vs-Wick gap exposed as the `slack`. -/

/-- **The corrected capstone (existence form).**  Because the prize is free to *choose* `p`, one good
prime anywhere in the admissible family discharges the prize floor.  This is the precise sense in
which the over-dispersion is benign: the family may be arbitrarily over-dispersed, yet a *single*
prime under the slack closes the prize. -/

/-- **The uniform-sup form** (what the thin-above-onset data supports: *every* admissible prime good).
A uniform sup bound over a nonempty family trivially yields the existence form, hence the floor.  The
hypothesis here — `∀ i ∈ s, W i ≤ slack` — is the corrected open core: the worst-case wraparound at
deep `r ≈ log p` in the thin regime, for which the worst *computable* prime clears the bar by `> 99 %`. -/

/-- **Independence from the variance (the benign fact, restated at the capstone level).**  The
hypotheses of `prizeFloor_of_exists_good_prime` mention only the *pointwise* values `W i` and the
budget — never a second moment.  Concretely: the conclusion holds for the maximally over-dispersed
family `W = ![slack, 0]` (which has `Var > mean` once `slack > 2`, by
`_OverdispersionObstructsVariance.overdispersion_is_benign`) exactly as it holds for any other family,
because index `0` is good (`W 0 = slack ≤ slack`).  Over-dispersion is irrelevant to the prize. -/
