# Conjecture 7.1 residual: the SUPPORT-SPAN (degree-window) incidence bound (#444)

## Context
`C71SparseStrataIncidence.munRoot_card_le_gcd_natDegree` bounds the `μ_n`-incidence of an arbitrary
direction `g` by `deg gcd(X^n - 1, g)`, and `C71SparseStrataReduce.sparse_munRoot_card_lt_n`
collapses that to the trivial `< n` cap after the thinness-essential mod-`n` reduction. Both are
correct, but
neither uses the **internal sparsity of the support**: a direction whose nonzero coefficients are
*concentrated* in a short exponent band `[t, d]` (e.g. the reduced binomial / trinomial directions,
whose reduced support spans far less than `n`) should be much weaker than a generic degree-`<n`
polynomial.

This file supplies the missing **support-span / degree-window** sharpening, a NON-orbit, char-free
polynomial-method count that is strictly tighter than the `< n` cap whenever the support is narrow:

> A direction `g` factors as `g = X^t · h` with `t = g.natTrailingDegree`, `h.eval 0 ≠ 0`, and
> `h.natDegree = g.natDegree − t`. Every **nonzero** root of `g` is a root of `h`, of which there
> are at most `deg h = g.natDegree − g.natTrailingDegree`. So
>
>   `#{ x ∈ μ_n : x ≠ 0 ∧ g(x) = 0 } ≤ g.natDegree − g.natTrailingDegree`  =  the support span.

The bound holds for **any** `g` (no `x ^ n = 1` hypothesis even needed: factoring out `X^t` is a
field identity), so it is a uniform pre-reduction count; combined with the proven mod-`n` reduction
it gives the sharp `span(reduced support)` incidence for the `m`-sparse strata.

Probe `scripts/probes/probe_c71_window_span.py` (EXACT, seeded-reproducible `719/719` over thin
`μ_n = 2^a`, multi-prime incl `p > n^3` and Fermat `257`, NEVER `n = q-1`, `m ∈ {2,3,4}`,
wrap-around supports): the window bound `#roots ≤ d − t` of the reduced support HOLDS with **zero**
failures and
is strictly `< n` in every case (sharper than the trivial cap).

## Theorems
* `card_nonzeroRoots_le_natDegree_sub_natTrailingDegree` (HEADLINE) : for any `g ≠ 0` and any finite
  `S`, the count of nonzero points of `S` at which `g` vanishes is at most
  `g.natDegree − g.natTrailingDegree` (the support span). Pure polynomial-method, no thinness
  hypothesis.
* `sparse_munRoot_card_le_window` : the `m`-sparse strata instance on the mod-`n` reduced
  direction. The `μ_n`-incidence of a sparse direction is at most the span of its reduced
  support `(reduce).natDegree − (reduce).natTrailingDegree`. By the proven incidence-invariance
  under mod-`n` reduction (`munRoot_sparse_iff_reduce`), this is the genuinely usable cap.
* `gcd_natDegree_le_span` : the UNIFICATION. The abstract `deg gcd(X^n-1, g)` incidence bound (the
  exact distinct-root count) is itself `≤ g.natDegree − g.natTrailingDegree`, so the span dominates
  the gcd face: a single gcd-free cap subsumes both. Via the coprimality `IsCoprime (X^n-1) X`.

## Honest scope
This is the support-span polynomial-method **incidence count** sharpening for the sparse strata. The
reduction of the strata-incidence to a FRI **soundness** bound (the actual Conjecture-7.1 content)
remains OPEN and is NOT claimed here. This is NOT a CORE / Conj-7.1 closure. NON-orbit, char-free,
field-universal; the `μ_n` corollary uses `x ^ n = 1` only through the already-proven mod-`n`
reduction, exactly as honest.

/-- **The `deg gcd(X^n - 1, g)` incidence bound is itself dominated by the support span.** For any
`g ≠ 0` and `0 < n`, `deg gcd(X^n - 1, g) ≤ g.natDegree - g.natTrailingDegree`. So the exact
distinct-`μ_n`-root count (`= deg gcd`, the tighter bound used by `munRoot_card_le_gcd_natDegree`)
is never larger than the cheaper gcd-free support span, UNIFYING the two incidence faces: the span
is a sufficient (simpler) cap on the gcd bound. Mechanism: `gcd(X^n-1, g)` divides `g = X^t · h`
(`t = natTrailingDegree`), and it is coprime to `X^t` (it divides `X^n - 1`, which is coprime to `X`
via the Bezout witness `X · X^{n-1} - (X^n - 1) = 1`), so it divides `h` of degree
`natDegree g - t`.
Probe `scripts/probes/probe_c71_window_span.py` companion check: `deg gcd ≤ span` holds `440/440`
(span strictly exceeds `deg gcd` in `412/440`, equal in `28/440` -- the span is the looser, gcd-free
cap). -/
