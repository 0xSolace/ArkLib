# n-ary message-seam `seqCompose` perfect completeness for **oracle** reductions (issue #29)

`Reduction.seqCompose_perfectCompleteness_threaded`
(`SeqComposePerfectCompletenessThreaded.lean`) is the fully-proven `Reduction`-level engine:
the `seqCompose` of `P_to_V`-leading, perfectly-complete component reductions is perfectly
complete. The ring-switching / BCS consumers compose **oracle** reductions
(`OracleReduction.seqCompose`), whose `seqCompose` definitionally unfolds (via
`OracleReduction.seqCompose_succ`/`seqCompose_zero`) into a tower of `OracleReduction.append`s and
`OracleReduction.id`.

`OracleReduction.perfectCompleteness oR` is *definitionally* `Reduction.perfectCompleteness
oR.toReduction`. So the only content needed to lift the engine to the oracle setting is the
structural bridge

  `(OracleReduction.seqCompose Stmt OStmt Wit R).toReduction
     = Reduction.seqCompose Stmt Wit (fun i => (R i).toReduction)`,

i.e. that the oracle `seqCompose`'s `Verifier` image is the `Reduction`-level `seqCompose` of the
component `Verifier` images. This file proves that bridge by induction (`seqCompose_toReduction`,
discharging each append seam with the already-proven `appendToReductionResidual_proof`), and then
the oracle-level n-ary keystone `OracleReduction.seqCompose_perfectCompleteness_threaded` is a pure
rewrite into the `Reduction`-level engine — no new probabilistic content, no `sorry`, no residual.

/-- **Structural `toReduction`/`seqCompose` bridge.** The `Reduction` image of a `seqCompose`d
oracle reduction is the `Reduction`-level `seqCompose` of the component `Reduction` images.

Proven by induction on `m`: the base case is `OracleReduction.id_toReduction` (the empty
`seqCompose` is `OracleReduction.id`, whose image is `Reduction.id`, the empty `Reduction`
`seqCompose`); the step unfolds both sides via `seqCompose_succ` to a binary `append` and uses
`appendToReductionResidual_proof` (`(R₁.append R₂).toReduction = R₁.toReduction.append
R₂.toReduction`) plus the inductive hypothesis. -/

/-- **n-ary message-seam `seqCompose` perfect completeness for oracle reductions (issue #29).**
Every component is nonempty and `P_to_V`-leading (`hValid`) and perfectly complete (`h`); with
per-round challenge finiteness/inhabitedness the oracle-level `seqCompose` is perfectly complete.

Pure pass-through to the proven `Reduction`-level engine
`Reduction.seqCompose_perfectCompleteness_threaded` via the structural `toReduction` bridge
`seqCompose_toReduction` (oracle perfect completeness is definitionally the `toReduction`'s perfect
completeness; the bridge rewrites the oracle `seqCompose`'s image to the `Reduction`-level
`seqCompose` of the component images). No residual, no `sorry`. -/
