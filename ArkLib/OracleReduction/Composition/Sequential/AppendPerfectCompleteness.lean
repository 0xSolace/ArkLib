# Perfect completeness of sequential composition (`Reduction.append`)

The append-completeness theorem in `Append.lean` (`reduction_append_perfectCompleteness`) is
residual-gated: it takes its own conclusion as the hypothesis
`reductionAppendPerfectCompletenessResidual`. This file discharges that residual for the
message-seam case, i.e. it proves

`(R₁.append R₂).perfectCompleteness` from `R₁.perfectCompleteness` and `R₂.perfectCompleteness`

*without* assuming the conclusion.

## Proof outline (support-decomposition — no distributional reordering needed)

`(R₁.append R₂).run` runs both provers then both verifiers: order `P₁, P₂, V₁, V₂`. A *distribution*
identity would need to commute `V₁` past `P₂`, but **perfect completeness only needs support
containment** (`probEvent_eq_one_iff`: `Pr[p|mx] = 1 ↔ Pr[⊥|mx] = 0 ∧ ∀ x ∈ support mx, p x`), and
support decomposes through `bind` *without* reordering (`mem_support_bind_iff`). So we never commute
anything; we decompose the support directly:

1. `Prover.append_run_msg` factors the appended prover run into `P₁.run` then `P₂.run`, and
   `Verifier.append_run` (`rfl`) splits the verifier into `V₁.run stmt₁ tr₁` then `V₂.run · tr₂`.
2. Take any outcome in the support. `mem_support_bind_iff` exposes
   `(tr₁,s₂,w₂) ∈ support (P₁.run)`, `sv₂ ∈ support (V₁.run stmt₁ tr₁)`,
   `(tr₂,s₃,w₃) ∈ support (P₂.run s₂ w₂)`, `sv₃ ∈ support (V₂.run sv₂ tr₂)`.
3. `h₁` applied to the `R₁.run` outcome `((tr₁,s₂,w₂), sv₂)` gives `sv₂ = s₂ ∧ (sv₂,w₂) ∈ rel₂`,
   hence `(s₂,w₂) ∈ rel₂` and `sv₂ = s₂`.
4. Rewriting `sv₂ = s₂`, the tail is exactly the `R₂.run s₂ w₂` outcome `((tr₂,s₃,w₃), sv₃)`;
   `h₂` (valid since `(s₂,w₂) ∈ rel₂`) gives `(sv₃,w₃) ∈ rel₃ ∧ sv₃ = s₃` — i.e. the goal.

The `hImplSupp` hypothesis (the appended verifier's stateful oracle queries have state-independent
*support*) is what makes the support decomposition go through despite a stateful `impl`; it is exactly
why the support route works where a naive distributional route would also have to track `σ`-state.

## Status

In-progress formalization of the support-decomposition argument above. The prover-run factoring is
consumed from the already-proven `Append`/`AppendRunEvalDist` keystones; the remaining content is the
`mem_support_bind_iff` decomposition + pointwise application of `h₁`, `h₂`.

This discharges `reductionAppendPerfectCompletenessResidual` for the message-first second protocol:
the genuine append-completeness theorem, proving the conclusion from the two component perfect
