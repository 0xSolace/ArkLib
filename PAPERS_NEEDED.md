## Prize-regime sub-Johnson list-decoding reading list (issue #389/#371, 2026-06-13)

The deep-band MCA programme reduces (issue #389) to: bound the sub-Johnson
list size of EXPLICIT smooth-domain (dyadic μ_{2^μ}) Reed–Solomon codes.

Also re-check in-tree: ECCC TR25-169 (barrier), ePrint 2026/861 (action-orbit),
2026/858 (threshold-halving) — listed above, may bear on the dyadic explosion.

## δ* OPEN-CORE reading list — 2026-06-13 (the L²→L^∞ sup-norm gap)

Added by the δ* lane. The prize reduces (fleet's `MCAShawConjecture` = small-subgroup additive
energy = beyond-Johnson RS list decoding) to **square-root cancellation for character sums over the
small multiplicative subgroup `μ_{2^k}` (`n ≈ p^{1/5}`)** — specifically the **sup** (L^∞) of the
incomplete sum `S(t)=Σ_{a∈μ_n} e_p(ta)`, which the moment-vs-max gap makes up to `√n` larger than the
provable L²/L⁴ (=additive-energy) average. These (all NEW to the catalog, verified absent) target
that exact gap from adjacent domains. None is on disk; URLs given for fetch. (O6–O7 added by the
demand/list-decoding seat from the O173 research sweep — the two newest Stepanov-method handles on
the exact `S(t)` / additive-`μ_n` object, verified absent by arXiv id.)

The pseudopolynomial construction is a candidate per-frequency √-cancellation tool for the L^∞ sup-norm of `S(t)` precisely in the sub-`√q` degree regime where `μ_n` (`n≈p^{1/5}`) lives — the closest modern Stepanov-on-character-values to the open core (algorithmic, so it informs the technique, not yet the extremal bound). |
| O7 | Kalmynin, **On additive irreducibility of multiplicative subgroups** (Apr 2025) | arXiv **2504.10202** | https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10202 | Hanson–Petridis **Stepanov on sumsets of `d`-th roots of unity** (resolves Sárközy's QR conjecture; `A−A=μ_d∪{0} ⟹ d∈{2,6}`). Studies the **additive structure of `μ_d` itself** — the same spurious-additive-relation / sumset-of-roots-of-unity object that governs the `E_j` excess (`SubsetSumHaloEnergy`) and `B(μ_n)`'s bad-prime spread; an impossibility-type result (`μ_d` additively irreducible bar `d∈{2,6}`) is the structural input the energy/halo route's worst case needs. |

**Honest scope:** these are LEADS on the open core, not a closure. The prize remains open: no known
technique gives √-cancellation for `μ_n` at `n ≈ p^{1/5}` (BGK gives only `n^{1−ν}`, astronomically
small ν). Context: the additive-energy clean-threshold is exponential (`p > 2ⁿ`), so the prize regime
(`p ≈ n⁵`) is not settled by the energy route; and the naive "Shaw flatness" sup-norm constant `√2` is
refuted — the true core is this L²→L^∞ (moment-vs-max) gap. See `docs/kb/deltastar-research-map.md`
§(b)/(ii) and `ShawOperator.lean` / `PROXIMITY_PRIZE_WORKBENCH.lean` §3.

## δ* OPEN-CORE reading list addendum — 2026-06-13b (generic→explicit list-decoding capacity)

The prize's list-decoding face reduces to: does the EXPLICIT smooth/subgroup (NTT) domain inherit
list-decoding capacity that GENERIC (random) RS evaluation points provably achieve (BGM23, via
higher-order MDS / GM-MDS / reduced-intersection-matrices — the fleet's active GM-MDS lane,
`higher-order-mds-formalization-blueprint.md`, `LovettThm17Reduction.lean`)? The structured domain is
exactly the non-generic case the BGM machinery does NOT cover. These 3 are NEW to the catalog (verified
absent) and pin the explicit-vs-generic gap. None on disk; URLs for fetch.

| # | paper | id / venue | URL | why it bears on the open core |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Berman–Shany–Tamo, **Explicit Subcodes of Reed–Solomon Codes that Efficiently Achieve List Decoding Capacity** (IEEE-IT 2025) | arXiv **2401.15034** | https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15034 | EXPLICIT, no-randomness capacity via **orbits of two affine transformations with coprime orders** + tensor/cyclic-shift, length=field size, non-prime fields OK. Closest analogue to a structured-domain capacity result; its orbit/cyclic technique is a candidate for the smooth-subgroup μ_n case (though it is a folded subcode, not plain RS on μ_n — the gap). |
| C2 | **Randomly Punctured Reed–Solomon Codes Achieve List-Decoding Capacity over Linear-Sized Fields** (STOC 2024) | DOI **10.1145/3618260.3649634** (arXiv 2304.01403/2304.09445 versions on disk) | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3618260.3649634 | The field-size-optimal BGM successor: capacity over `O(n)` fields. The prize regime has `q≈n·2^128 ≫ n`, so field size is NOT the obstruction — isolating that the obstruction is purely the *structured* (non-random) evaluation set. |
| C3 | **Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families** | arXiv **2502.13877** (2025) | https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877 | List-RECOVERY (the LD grand-challenge's multi-list generalization, the form correlated agreement feeds into); near-optimal bounds for linear-code families — check whether its machinery applies to the RS/subgroup case past Johnson. |

**Honest scope:** leads on the generic→explicit gap, NOT a closure. BGM-style results need the
evaluation points GENERIC (random / general position); the prize's smooth μ_n domain is maximally
structured (a subgroup), which is precisely why no published result reaches capacity for it. The
fleet's GM-MDS lane (Theorem 1.7 → one coordinate-merge residual) is the in-tree attack on this route.

## δ* halo-residual — the "house of Gaussian periods" thread (2026-06-13, distinct community)

The residual `max_c|η_c|` is exactly the **house (max conjugate modulus) of a Gaussian period**.
A SEPARATE research community (Duke–Garcia–et al., supercharacter theory + explicit norms/moments,
Hasse–Weil) studies precisely this object — distinct toolset from the Katz/Bourgain analytic thread
above. Verified via web search (Jun 2026); none on disk.

| # | paper | id | why it bears on the residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | **The Norm of Gaussian Periods** | arXiv **1611.07287** | Asymptotics of the logarithmic absolute NORM `Π_c η_c` (improves trivial bound) — the geometric-mean companion to the house `max_c|η_c|`; lower-bounds the house via `house ≥ |norm|^{1/m}`. |
| G2 | **Moments of Gaussian Periods and Modified Fermat Curves** | arXiv **2112.13886** | Computes the 4th absolute moment of Gaussian periods via **Hasse–Weil on Fermat curves** — EXACTLY the `E_2=3n²−3n` energy floor the in-tree `ShawFlatnessRefuted`/`SidonModNeg` use, from the curve side; the higher-moment generalisation is the prize's open `E_r`. Ties to the in-tree Hasse-multiplicity curve programme. |
| G3 | **The graphic nature of Gaussian periods** (Duke–Garcia–Lutz) | arXiv **1212.6825** | Foundational supercharacter framework + empirical house/value-distribution structure of `{η_c}`; the structural lens on why generic `μ_n` looks random (the genericity certificate). |

**Honest scope:** the Duke–Garcia norm/moment results are sharp for `n` a FIXED prime as `p→∞`
(opposite of the prize's growing dyadic `n=2^k`), so the same uniformity gap remains — but the
supercharacter + Hasse–Weil moment machinery is a genuinely different, formalizable handle on `E_r`
than the analytic Katz thread, and G2's curve method already underlies the in-tree 4th-moment floor.
The prize stays open; this widens the toolset on the named residual.

## δ* halo-residual — the Salem–Zygmund / generic-chaining route (2026-06-13, probability × NT)

NEW cross-field route (`docs/kb/deltastar-salem-zygmund-gausssum-chaining-2026-06-13.md`): the period
DFT identity `η_c=−1/m+(1/m)Σ_j τ(χ_j)e(−jc/m)` makes `max_c|η_c|` the SUP-NORM of the Gauss-sum
trigonometric polynomial. Prize ⟺ that sup-norm is Salem–Zygmund-generic `√(n log m)`; provable via a
sub-Gaussian MGF / generic-chaining bound (increment geometry only, NOT all moments). Papers (web,
Jun 2026; none on disk):

| # | paper | id | role in the route |
|---|---|---|---|
| SZ1 | Salem–Zygmund, **sup-norm of random trigonometric polynomials** (+ modern: Kahane *Some Random Series of Functions*) | classical | the `‖P‖_∞≍√(N log N)` law the Gauss-sum poly must match; the random model to derandomize. |
| SZ2 | Talagrand, **generic chaining / γ₂ bound on sub-Gaussian suprema** | *Upper and Lower Bounds for Stochastic Processes* (+ arXiv 1309.3522 tail-via-chaining, 2511.06338 L^q empirical process) | the apparatus: bounds `E max_c|η_c|` from increment metric `d(c,c')=‖η_c−η_{c'}‖_{ψ₂}` — needs only MGF/increment geometry, not every moment. The feasibility win. |
| SZ3 | **Equidistribution and independence of Gauss sums** | arXiv 2207.12439 (Adv. Math. 2024) | the derandomizer: joint independence of `{τ(χ_j)}` ⟹ the MGF factors ⟹ sub-Gaussian proxy `n`. Open part = uniformity over `m−1` chars. |

**Honest scope:** this reframes the open core into a Salem–Zygmund/sub-Gaussian-MGF statement with a
mature toolkit (Deligne–Katz equidistribution + Talagrand chaining), strictly weaker than the raw
all-moments wall — but the quantitative joint Gauss-sum independence over `m−1≈p/n` characters at thin
`n≈p^{0.12}` remains open. A better-tooled route, not a closure. The prize stays open.

## δ* — the Lamzouri value-distribution CLT edge (2026-06-13, decisive localization)
The prize ⟺ extending the Gaussian value-distribution CLT past its proven `log H=o(log q)` range to
fixed-power length `n=p^β`. See `deltastar-salem-zygmund-gausssum-chaining-2026-06-13.md` §"DECISIVE".
- Lamzouri, **The distribution of short character sums**, arXiv **1106.6072** (Camb. Phil. Soc.) — 2-D
  Gaussian limit for `log H=o(log q)`, quantitative Kolmogorov rate; the proven positive direction.

## ExcessCensusLaw analytic core (general-r deep-band #bad-scalar / e1-e2 joint level-set — #389 demand-side lane)
The r=3 deep-band #bad-scalar bound is CLOSED in-tree (`DeepBandR3Bound.lean`, O172 closed form #bad = n*C(n/4,2)+1 <= K, axiom-clean). The remaining obligation past r=3 — the general-r deep-band #bad count, equivalently the magnitude of the (e1,e2)-joint level-set / m-th moment subset-sum count over a multiplicative subgroup (the ExcessCensusLaw analytic core) — is OPEN and blocked on exactly these papers.

## δ* — the Favard-length / self-similar NON-MOMENT route (2026-06-13, harmonic analysis × NT)
The impossibility map forces a non-moment method; this is the first that fits the dyadic tower. See

## δ* OPEN-CORE reading list addendum — 2026-06-13c (state-of-the-art subgroup-sum bounds; the BGK→Burgess gap)

Independent literature re-confirmation (fleet already has the state-of-the-art Di Benedetto bound in
`deltastar-literature-findings-2026-06-13.md`). The prize core `max_c|Σ_{x∈μ_n}e_p(cx)| ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}`
at `n~p^{1/4}` is OPEN; the best PUBLISHED bound is the BGK-family power-saving:
- **Di Benedetto–Garaev–García–González-Sánchez–Shparlinski–Trujillo (2020, arXiv 2003.06165)**:
  `n^{1−31/2880+o(1)}` for `n>p^{1/4}` — `δ≈0.0108`, vs the prize-needed `δ=1/2`. This is the SOTA and
  the precise distance to the prize: ~45× in the power-saving exponent. No √-cancellation exists.
3 papers NEW to catalog (on-topic additive-combinatorics/char-sum; NONE a √-cancellation breakthrough):

| # | paper | id | URL | bearing on the core |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Restricted sumsets in multiplicative subgroups** | arXiv **2309.10950** | https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10950 | restricted/structured sumsets inside μ_n — the additive structure governing the energy/excess; check vs the antipodal/Lam-Leung characterization. |
| S2 | **Structure theory of set addition with two operations** (2026) | arXiv **2601.12457** | https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12457 | sum-product / two-operation structure — the engine class behind BGK; whether its newest form sharpens the subgroup power-saving. |
| S3 | **Mixed character sums modulo prime powers** (2026) | arXiv **2604.02614** | https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.02614 | mixed (additive×multiplicative) char sums; prize is mod prime but the amplification technique may transfer to the subgroup case. |

**Honest scope:** these are leads on the BGK→Burgess gap, NOT a closure. The published SOTA
(`n^{1−1/2880}`) confirms the prize's `n^{1/2}` cancellation is a recognized open problem with no
current solution; every moment-method route is ruled out (`deltastar-moment-method-convergence-diagnosis`),
and the only non-moment hope is a Stepanov/Burgess amplification that does not yet exist.

## 2026-06-13 (c) — polynomial-method / subgroup-energy papers (the slice-rank lane check)
- arXiv:1712.00410 — Murphy-Rudnev-Shkredov-Shteinikov, few-products-many-sums. RECORD subgroup energy E<~|A|^{2.45}; incidence+sum-product (NOT slice rank). The current wall.
- arXiv:1102.1172 — Heath-Brown-Konyagin, additive shifts of multiplicative subgroups. Stepanov: E<<|A|^{5/2}, |A|<<p^{2/3}. The Stepanov ceiling.
- arXiv:1905.07355 — Costa-Dalai, gap in slice rank of k-tensors. Slice rank fails for >=8-term systems; energy is in the weak regime.
- arXiv:2304.13801 / 2309.09124 — Hanson-Petridis, additive decompositions / multiplicative structure of shifted subgroups. Most-adaptable Stepanov refinement; still cannot break the degree-vs-multiplicity balance.
- Slice-rank survey (Surveys in Combinatorics 2024, Cambridge) — confirms slice rank is an avoidance-size method needing F_q^n; no subgroup-energy application exists.
## δ* EFFECTIVE-EQUIDISTRIBUTION cluster — 2026-06-14 (the FIXED-INDEX wall, NOT thin-BGK)

Added by the regime-clarification lane (probe `probe_fixed_index_supnorm_ratio.py`). **Key
reframing:** the prize fixes `q≈n·2^128`, i.e. index `m=(q−1)/n≈2^128` HELD CONSTANT as the
FFT domain `n→∞`. This is a *fixed-index, positive-proportion* (`n=Θ(p)`) subgroup family — the
`β∈[4,5]` figure is the *derived* `β=1+128/log₂n`, NOT a fixed thin-subgroup exponent. So the
analytic wall is **effective Gauss-sum equidistribution** (the `m` fixed Gauss-sum phases must
avoid alignment at the specific `p≈2^160`), geometrically distinct from additive-combinatorial
BGK/Paley (thin `n=p^{δ}`, `δ<1`). All 5 ON DISK at `~/papers/arklib/`.

| # | paper | id | why it bears on the FIXED-INDEX wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| EQ1 | Perret-Gentil (et al.), **Wasserstein metrics and quantitative equidistribution of exponential sums over finite fields** | arXiv **2505.22059** (2025) | THE effective version of Deligne/Katz equidistribution. Gives `W₁`-discrepancy of trace-function families via Weyl sums — `√p`-quality (conductor/`√p`). **Confirms the no-go:** this quality is `≫ 1/m` needed to certify flatness of `m=2^128` phases at `p≈2^160`, so effective-Katz alone cannot close the prize (but is the right machine for the fixed-index framing). |
| EQ2 | Rojas-León, **Equidistribution and independence of Gauss sums** | arXiv **2207.12439** | Proves joint independence/equidistribution of Gauss sums for `n` monomials in `r`-variable mult. characters — the QUALITATIVE (q→∞) non-conspiracy of exactly our phases `τ(ψ^j)/√p`. The prize is its EFFECTIVE form. |
| EQ3 | **On an uncertainty principle for small index subgroups of finite fields** | arXiv **2310.09992** | ★ DECISIVE BRIDGE. The **nonvanishing-minors (NVM) property of the compressed Fourier matrix of a subgroup H** = the higher-order-MDS / repeated-degree generalized-Vandermonde nonsingularity that **R3 `LovettPrimitiveStep` needs** — and it is characterized **via Gauss sums** (Chebotarëv on roots of unity). Solves index 2,3; **"larger index remains open"** (quote). So R3 (algebraic) and the analytic Gauss-period sup-norm are the **SAME open object**; the campaign's "independent routes" collapse. |
| EQ4 | **Improved bounds on Gauss sums in arbitrary finite fields** | arXiv **1712.00761** | SOTA effective single Gauss-sum / subgroup-sum bounds in `F_q`; the quantitative input feeding both walls. |
| EQ5 | Perret-Gentil, **Ultra-short sums of trace functions** | arXiv **2302.13670** | Equidistribution of *very short* trace-function sums over zeros of integral polynomials — the short-interval analogue of the incomplete `S(t)=Σ_{x∈μ_n}e_p(tx)` sup-norm tail. |

**Honest scope:** the fixed-index reframing moves the prize OFF the (hopeless) thin-BGK wall onto
the effective-equidistribution wall — but `probe_fixed_index_supnorm_ratio.py` + the conductor
estimate (EQ1) show BOTH walls, and the moment/Betti route, give only **poly(m)·p^{−1/2}** quality
while certifying no-alignment of `m≈2^128` phases needs **`≤1/m`** quality. The wall is therefore
*framing-independent* (triangulated 3 ways), and remains open. New empirical law (the one clean
positive): `R(n,m) := M/√(n·ln m)` is FLAT ≈ 1.1–1.5 across `n:16→2048` and index `m:13→8206`
(thinning to `n=p^{1/2.63}`) — so the `log(p/n)` factor in `δ*=1−ρ−H(ρ)/(β log₂n)` is the EXACT
normalization, worst-case constant `C≈1.5`, not merely an upper bound.

## 2026-06-13 (d) — 5 new papers on the EXACT prize core (incomplete additive char sum over μ_n)

The #407 core localizes to `M(n) = max_{b≠0} |Σ_{x∈μ_n} e_p(bx)| ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}` at `n ~ p^{1/4}`
(the additive character over a small multiplicative subgroup — the Gauss-sum-like object, distinct
from the multiplicative-char sums already cataloged). SOTA = BGK power-saving `n^{1-1/2880}`
(Di Benedetto et al, 2003.06165). 5 leads, 2 downloaded to `~/papers/arklib/`:

| # | paper | id / source | status | bearing on the core |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **Exponential sums over small subgroups, revisited** (2024) | arXiv **2401.04756** | DOWNLOADED | THE exact object — revisits BGK-type bounds for `Σ e_p(bx)`, `x∈μ_n` small; the current best-technique reference for the prize core. |
| E2 | **Bounds on exponential sums over small multiplicative subgroups** (Bourgain–Chang) | arXiv **0705.4573** | needs DL | the original small-subgroup additive-character cancellation; foundation for the `n^{1/2}` target and where the power-saving started. |
| E3 | **Multiplicative Energy of Shifted Subgroups and Bounds on Exponential Sums with Trinomials** | Canad. J. Math (Cambridge) | needs DL | shifted-subgroup energy + **trinomial** exp sums — the trinomial is precisely the monomial-far-line direction `X^b+γX^a`; the energy route in the live regime. |
| E4 | **Multiplicative character sums over subsets of quadratic extensions** (2025) | arXiv **2502.14436** | DOWNLOADED | recent char-sum machinery over structured subsets of `F_{p^2}` — technique transfer to the subgroup case. |
| E5 | **Shparlinski — Open Problems on Exponential and Character Sums** | web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/CharSumProjects.pdf | reference | the canonical open-problem list; confirms the prize core is recognized-open and names the adjacent attackable sub-problems (Burgess/Stepanov amplification — the only non-moment hope). |

**Honest scope (unchanged):** none of these is a `n^{1/2}` √-cancellation breakthrough; the published
SOTA `n^{1-1/2880}` and Shparlinski's problem list both confirm the prize core is a recognized open
problem in analytic number theory. Moment methods are exhausted (energy ≤ `n^{2+o(1)}`, the 7/3
barrier). E1+E3 are the most relevant — the revisited-small-subgroup technique and the trinomial
(= monomial-line) energy bound, in the live `n~p^{1/4}` regime.
## Proximity-prize reduced-form: the EXACT Gauss-sum-sup-norm / resonance face (added 2026-06-13b)

The δ* conjecture `max_b|η_b(μ_n)| ≤ √2·√(n log(q/n))` reduces to **resonance-freeness of the Gauss-sum
phases {τ(χ)}** (no `b` aligns Ω(f) of them) = the large-values/sup-norm problem for `∑_χ χ̄(b)τ(χ)`.
Targeted research (this session) — this input is NEITHER proven NOR resonance-refutable:

8.  arXiv:1604.01007 "On period polynomials of degree 2^m for finite fields" — the DYADIC period
    polynomials; explicit factorizations for `p≡3,5 (mod 8)`, but NOT root-magnitude (sup-norm) bounds
    in the `n~q^{1/4}` regime. Closest structural match; check if its 2-adic factorization constrains
    the max real period.
9.  Bondarenko–Seip, "The resonance method for large character sums", Mathematika — resonance LOWER
    bounds `√N·exp(c√(log N/log log N))` for multiplicative character sums over intervals. Refutation
    direction. Does NOT transfer to `∑_χ χ̄(b)τ(χ)` (rigid orthogonal dual-group sum, not a
    multiplicative interval sum; combination law contractive) — consistent with measured `C→√2`, no
    resonance blow-up. So the conjecture is NOT resonance-refutable.
10. arXiv:1712.00761 "Improved bounds on Gauss sums in arbitrary finite fields" — upper bounds for
    `∑χ(x^n)` up to order `q^{1/2+1/68}`; power-saving, not the sup-norm √-cancellation.
11. arXiv:1207.1607 Demirci Akarsu–Marklof "The value distribution of incomplete Gauss sums" — limit
    law for QUADRATIC incomplete Gauss sums (interval-restricted); different object (quadratic phase),
    but the "incomplete sum has richer value distribution than the complete √q-normalized one" theme is
    the same flavor as the subgroup sup-norm.
12. arXiv:2406.01519 (2024) — flagged by search under resonance/large-character-sums; obtain & check.

VERDICT (this session): the prize's open input (Gauss-sum resonance-freeness / sup-norm `≤√(n log)`) is
at the genuine research frontier — no proven bound reaches it, and resonance does not refute it. Cannot
be closed by citation; not fabricated.

## 2026-06-14 (#407): literature sweep — SOTA on both prize faces, confirms the gap is the open core
The prize δ* = where the worst far-line list crosses budget n. Two equivalent faces, both with SOTA
FAR from the prize target — confirming the core is open (the gap itself):
| # | Paper | Identifier | Bearing |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Di Benedetto–Garaev–García–González-Sánchez–Shparlinski–Trujillo, *New estimates for exp sums over mult subgroups* | arXiv 2003.06165 | **SOTA char-sum face**: `max_a|Σ_{x∈H}e_p(ax)| ≤ |H|^{1−31/2880+o(1)}` for `|H|>p^{1/4}` — improves BGK, but is `n^{1−o(1)}`, FAR from prize `√(n log(q/n))=n^{1/2+o(1)}`. The gap IS the open core. |
| L2 | Shangguan–Tamo, *Combinatorial list-decoding of RS beyond the Johnson radius* | arXiv 1911.01502 | beyond-Johnson list size, but GENERIC/intersection-based, not dyadic μ_n worst case |
| L3 | Goldberg–Shangguan–Tamo (Ferber–Kwan–Sauermann line), *List-decodability with large radius for RS* | arXiv 2012.10584 | RS list-decodable to `1−ε`, rate `Ω(ε)` — but RANDOM/punctured eval points, `q≥n^{1+δ}`, NOT structured dyadic |
| L4 | *List-decoding & list-recovery of RS beyond Johnson for any rate* | arXiv 2105.14754 | any-rate beyond-Johnson, again generic eval sets, not the prize's fixed μ_n |
| L5 | *Weil sums over small subgroups* | arXiv 2211.07739 | Weil-type bounds for subgroup sums; complements the char-sum face |
VERDICT: the SOTA char-sum bound (Di Benedetto `n^{1−31/2880}`) and the beyond-Johnson RS list bounds
(random points) both MISS the dyadic prize regime by a polynomial factor. The prize = closing exactly
that gap = the recognized open grand list-decoding / Gauss-sum-sup-norm challenge. No 2024–2026 paper
closes the structured dyadic case. Confirms (literature-grounded) the open core every campaign framing
converges to.

## 2026-06-13 (#407): second sweep — the Paley-spectrum + char-p Lam–Leung faces (the char-p transfer wall)
The char-0 optimality is now axiom-clean Lean (`full_tower` etc.); the SOLE residual is the **char-p
transfer** (does a short gap-vanishing config of `2^μ`-th roots over `F_q` lift to a char-0 coset-union).
This sweep maps the two literatures that bound that exact object. NONE reach the prize scale.
| # | Paper | Identifier | Bearing |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Podestá–Videla, *The nature of the spectrum of generalized Paley graphs and weak Waring numbers* | arXiv 2604.06513 (Apr 2026) | freshest; spectrum of `Cay(F_q,μ_k)` = Gaussian periods = the `η_b`. **STRUCTURAL ONLY** (when real/integral, period ≥3) — confirms NO new eigenvalue-MAGNITUDE bound exists for thin subgroups. |
| P2 | Podestá–Videla, *Spectral properties of generalized Paley graphs* | arXiv 2310.15378 | explicit Gauss-period spectra for index `k≤4`, `k=5` — the eigenvalues ARE the open-core periods; no thin-`n~q^{1/4}` magnitude bound. |
| P3 | Lam–Leung, *On vanishing sums of roots of unity* (+ char-p `W_p(m)` extension, arXiv math/9605216) | — | the char-p transfer = `W_p(2^μ)=ℕp+2ℕ`: gives weight-PARITY of a vanishing sum (`w<p ⟹ w even`) but NOT coset structure; the only general lift = norm bound `w^{φ(m)}<p`, unreachable at prize scale. |
| P4 | *Note on vanishing power sums of roots of unity* | arXiv 1503.07281 | simultaneous power-sum vanishing structure (our gap window is many `p_j=0` at once — the one place a poly-height argument could live). |
| P5 | Alsetri, *Burgess-type character sum estimates over generalized arithmetic progressions of rank 2* | arXiv 2509.07765 (BLMS 2026) | closest recent TECHNIQUE (mult-energy + Bohr-set/geometry-of-numbers à la Konyagin) but rank-2 GAP ≠ mult subgroup; does not transfer to `μ_n`. |
| P6 | Kambiré, *Proximity Gaps Conjecture Fails Near Capacity over Prime Fields* | arXiv 2604.09724 / eprint 2026/782 | the construction paper itself (the δ* lower bracket = monomial line `X^{rm}+λX^{(r−1)m}`, `λ∈H^{(+r)}`). |
VERDICT: the two literatures that bound the char-p transfer object (Paley spectrum = Gauss periods;
char-p Lam–Leung weight sets) are STRUCTURAL — neither gives a magnitude/lift bound reaching the prize
`q=n^β` for `n~q^{1/4}`. Confirms the residual is the recognized open core, not a literature lookup.

## 2026-06-13 (#407): CURRENT open-problem status of the reduced core (Paley graph conjecture)
The prize floor = BCHKS Conj 1.12 = Paley-graph-conjecture territory. Most up-to-date literature status:
| # | Paper | Identifier | Bearing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | *Randomstrasse101: Open Problems of 2025* | arXiv 2603.29571 (31 Mar 2026) | **DECISIVE**: curated random-structures open-problem list, dated 3 months ago, STILL lists the Paley-graph clique number `ω(G_p)=O(polylog p)?` as OPEN. The reduced core is open in the current literature, full stop. |
| Q2 | Hanson–Petridis, *clique number of the Paley graph* (via Stepanov/polynomial method) | — | best PROVEN upper bound `ω(G_p) ≤ (1+o(1))√(p/2)` — the `√p` barrier, FAR from `polylog`/`√(n log q)`. The bound the prize needs to beat is exactly here, and it hasn't moved. |
VERDICT (current as of Jun 2026): the object the prize floor reduces to is on the March-2026 official
open-problems list. There is no known-math closure. A prize solution "reducing to proven math" must
supply a NEW sub-`√p` thin-subgroup character-sum / Paley bound that the 2026 open-problems list says
does not yet exist. (The "Paley graph conjecture on double character sums implies many character-sum
estimates" — it is the governing open conjecture, not a side lemma.)

## δ* — the "does smoothness beat BGK?" check (2026-06-14, NO-LEVER confirmed)

Tested whether the prize subgroup's 2-power/smooth order gives better-than-generic-BGK
cancellation for the sup bound. **Answer: NO** (size-governed, not smoothness-governed). 3 papers
on disk `~/papers/arklib/`.

The saving depends ONLY on the SIZE ratio `α=log\|H\|/log p` — **no smoothness/factorization dependence**. So the prize's 2-power order does NOT improve the analytic sup exponent; smoothness only feeds the moment/energy side (which caps at the Betti wall). Confirms the sup bound is the genuine size-governed BGK wall. |

**Honest finding:** the analytic sup bound `M ≤ C√(n log m)` is the BGK size-wall, NOT improvable by
the 2-power smoothness. The smoothness is genuinely useful ONLY on the char-0 moment scaffold
(Lam–Leung antipodal, `E_r ≤ (2r−1)‼·n^r`), which provably caps at the Betti depth `r=2` and cannot
reach the sup. So the two faces are decoupled: smoothness helps the (capped) moment side, the sup
side is size-governed and open. No smoothness lever exists for the prize.

## 2026-06-14 (e): the reduced object = additive energy of multiplicative subgroups

Face 3 reduces EXACTLY to `E_+(μ_n) ≤ n^{2+o(1)}` (equiv. `max_{b≠0}|Σ_{x∈μ_n}e_p(bx)| ≤
n^{1/2+o(1)}`), open: best proven HBK `n^{5/2}` (`n<p^{2/3}`), BGK `n^{1-ε}` power-saving. The
antipodal reduction (this session) restates it as: count short bounded-coeff polynomials
`D(X)` (`deg<n/2`, `Σ|coeff|≤2r`) with `D(g)≡0 mod p`. 5 papers on this exact object:
