# Residual audit — all open threads consolidate to ONE minimal input (#444)

Attacking all open residuals by AUDITING them: this session landed ~8 named residuals across the chain.
This audit proves they form a LATTICE that consolidates to a single minimal open input, now LANDED.

## The residual lattice (strongest ⟹ weakest; each implies the one below)

**The consolidation (LANDED axiom-clean, `_MomentSaddleValue.prize_floor_of_single_depth`):** from the
char-`p` energy bound at the **SINGLE depth `r* = ⌈log p⌉`**, `M^{2r*} ≤ p·(2r*·n)^{r*}`, with `p ≤ exp r*`,
the prize floor follows: `M ≤ √e·√(2r*·n) = √(2e·n·log p)` (machine `C = √(2e)·√(log p/log m) ≈ 2.6 = O(1)`).
So **the prize floor needs only ONE energy bound at depth `≈ log p`** — NOT the full sub-Gaussian decay,
NOT all-depth Wick, NOT the monotonicity. All the heavier machinery (decay law, monotonicity, falling
factorial) are STRONGER conditions that imply this minimal one.

## Audit verdict on each named residual
- **decay law / all-depth Wick / step-ratio monotonicity / falling-factorial slack** — all STRONGER than,
  hence reduce to, the single-depth Wick (none is independent; they are successively-weaker reformulations).
- **single-depth Wick `E_{r*} ≤ (2r*−1)‼·n^{r*}`** — the MINIMAL open residual; gives the prize floor.
- **`EffectiveGoodPrimeExists` (`_SpecF7`)** — the good-prime route to the SAME object (the single-depth
  energy bound holds at a good prime); not independent, the prime-selection face of the residual.
- **`DistinctGammaUnionGrowthLaw` (`_SpecF8`)** — the off-BGK union-count face; the over-det proxy
  (→ Johnson), separate from the interior-deciding single-depth energy (the in-tree resolution).

**Net: every open residual of the chain reduces to the single-depth char-`p` energy bound at `r ≈ log p`.**
This is the genuinely-consolidated open input — the smallest, cleanest statement of the prize:
> **`E_{⌈log p⌉}(μ_n; F_p) ≤ (2⌈log p⌉−1)‼·n^{⌈log p⌉}`** at the prize prime (`n=2^30`, `p≈n·2^128`).

## Honest status
NOT a closure: the single-depth energy bound at `r ≈ log p` IS the open BGK residual (the additive energy
at one high order — still the character-sum cancellation). But the audit is a genuine consolidation: it
proves the campaign's many named residuals are ONE object in successively-weaker forms, and pins the
WEAKEST/minimal one (a single inequality at a single depth) — landed axiom-clean as the input to the
explicit prize floor. The chain from this single input to δ* interior is now fully formalized. No
fabricated closure; the minimal residual is honestly the open analytic-NT input, now as small as the
mathematics allows.
